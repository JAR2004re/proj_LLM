      "lead": "Virat Kohli [ a ] (born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and the former all-format captain of the Indian national cricket team . [ 3 ] He is a right-handed batter and occasional right-arm medium pace bowler . Considered one of the greatest all-format batsmen in the history of cricket, he has been nicknamed the King, the Chase Master, and the Run Machine for his skills, records and ability to lead his team to victory. [ 4 ] Kohli has the most centuries in ODIs and the second-most centuries in international cricket with 85 tons across all formats. He is also the leading run-scorer in the Indian Premier League . [ 5 ] Kohli is the most successful Test captain of India with most wins and 3 consecutive Test mace retainments. [ 6 ] He is the only batter to earn 900+ rating points across all 3 formats. [ 7 ]\nKohli was the captain of the 2008 U19 World Cup winning team and was a crucial member of the teams that won 2011 ODI World Cup , 2013 Champions Trophy , 2024 T20 World Cup , and 2025 Champions Trophy . He plays for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League and for Delhi in domestic cricket . In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ODI batting rankings . In 2015, he achieved the same in T20I. [ 8 ] In 2018, he was ranked number one in Test, making him the only Indian to hold the number one spot in all three formats. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. He was the Cricketer of the Decade for 2011 to 2020 . [ 9 ]\nKohli has won ten ICC Awards , making him the most awarded player in international cricket history. He won the ODI Player of the Year award four times in 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He won the Cricketer of the Year award, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018. In 2018, he became the first player to win all three major awards including Cricketer of the Year, ODI Player of the Year and Test Player of the Year in the same year. He was honored with the Spirit of Cricket Award in 2019 and given the Cricketer of the Decade and ODI Cricketer of the Decade in 2020. Kohli was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years.\nKohli has the most Player of the Series and second most Player of the Match awards to his name in all three formats combined. He was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India's highest sporting honour, the Khel Ratna Award , in 2018. Time included him on its 100 most influential people in the world list in 2018. Kohli has been deemed one of the most commercially viable athletes, with estimated earnings of ₹ 634 crore (US$75 million) in the year 2022.\nAfter winning the 2024 T20 World Cup and winning the Player of the Match award in the final , Kohli announced his retirement from T20Is. [ 10 ] On 12 May 2025, aged 36, he announced his retirement from the Test format. [ 11 ] He is married to actress Anushka Sharma , and they have two children named Vamika and Akaay Kohli. [ 12 ]\nKohli was born on 5 November 1988 in New Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His mother Saroj Kohli is a homemaker while his father Prem Nath Kohli worked as a criminal lawyer. He has an elder brother Vikas and an elder sister Bhawna. His formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar . His early education was at Vishal Bharti Public School. [ 13 ] As per his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a 3-year-old. He would pick up a bat and request his father bowl to him. [ 14 ] In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created. In May, his father arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma . [ 15 ] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed his ability merited more than gully cricket . [ 16 ]\nKohli was unable to secure a place in the U-14 Delhi team, due to extraneous factors. His father reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would ensure his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the U-15 team. [ 17 ] He received training at the academy and participated in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave . [ 18 ] To further his cricket career, he transferred to Saviour Convent School during his ninth grade. [ 16 ] On 18 December 2006, his father died due to a cerebral attack . [ 19 ] As per his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took on cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport. [ 16 ] Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh , Paschim Vihar until 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon . [ 20 ]\nKohli's junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu Cricket Ground against Himachal Pradesh . His first half-century in domestic cricket happened at Feroze Shah Kotla , where he scored 70 runs against Haryana . [ 21 ] By the end of the season, he had amassed a total of 172 runs, emerging as the highest run-scorer for his side with an average of 34.40. [ 22 ] During the 2003–04 season of Polly Umrigar Trophy, Kohli was appointed the captain of the U-15 team. [ 22 ] He scored 54 runs in Delhi 's victory over Himachal Pradesh. In the next fixture against Jammu and Kashmir , Kohli scored his maiden century with a score of 119. By the end of the season, he had a total of 390 runs at an average of 78, which included two centuries. [ 23 ] Towards the end of 2004, Kohli earned selection for the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy with the Delhi U-17 team. [ 22 ] In the four matches that he played, Kohli had a total of 470 runs, with his highest score being 251 * runs. The team's coach, Ajit Chaudhary, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed with his temperament on the field. [ 24 ] He commenced the 2005–06 season with a score of 227 against Punjab . Following their victory over Uttar Pradesh in the quarter-finals, Delhi was scheduled to play against Baroda in the semi-finals. The team had high expectations from Kohli, who had promised his coach to finish the job. True to his word, Kohli went on to score 228 runs, leading Delhi to victory. The team later secured the tournament with a five-wicket win over Mumbai , where he contributed with a half-century in the first innings . [ 25 ] He ended as the highest run-scorer with a total of 757 runs from 7 matches, averaging 84.11. [ 26 ]\nOn 18 February 2006, Kohli made his debut in List A cricket, playing against Services in the Ranji One-Day Trophy , but he did not get the opportunity to bat during the match. [ 26 ] In 2006, Kohli got a spot in the state senior team. Subsequently, he made his first-class debut on 23 November 2006, during the opening match of the Ranji Trophy season against Tamil Nadu . However, his debut innings was a brief one, as he was dismissed after scoring ten runs. [ 27 ] In the subsequent match against former champions, Karnataka , Delhi found themselves trailing with a score of 130/5, with Kohli remaining unbeaten on 40 at the end of the day's play. That night, Kohli's father died. Despite the heart-wrenching news, Kohli returned to the match and continued to bat and scored 90 runs before he was dismissed. [ 28 ] Chetan Chauhan , the coach, was impressed by his determination and unwavering attitude in the face of adversity. Venkatesh Prasad lauded his crucial knock, which was executed in the midst of an emotional upheaval. After his dismissal, Kohli attended his father's funeral. His innings proved to be crucial for Delhi as they were able to avoid the follow-on . The team's captain, Mithun Manhas , praised Kohli for his performance, acknowledging its pivotal role in the team's success. [ 29 ]\nKohli's foray into T20 cricket first happened in April 2007, during the Inter-State T20 Championship , where he emerged as the top run-getter for his team with a tally of 179 runs at an average of 35.80. [ 30 ] In Sep 2008, Kohli played in Nissar Trophy against SNGPL . He emerged as the leading scorer for Delhi in both innings, registering 52 runs in the first innings and a towering 197 in the second. The match ultimately ended in a draw , SNGPL being declared the victors due to their lead in first innings. [ 31 ] In the 2009–10 Ranji Trophy season, Kohli returned to domestic cricket. During a match against Maharashtra , he opened the batting and scored 67 runs, helping Delhi to secure the bonus point required for victory. [ 32 ] Kohli's performance reinvigorated the competitive spirit of the domestic cricket circuit.\nIn July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England . He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s , while also averaging 49 in the 3-match Test series. Following India U-19 success in both the ODI and Test series, the team's coach Lalchand Rajput noted Kohli's adeptness in facing both pace and spin bowling and expressed his admiration for his technical prowess. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] In September, the U-19 team toured Pakistan. In the first Test match, Kohli scored 63 and 28 as India won by 271 runs against Pakistan Under-19s . In the 2nd match, he contributed 83 runs to India's victory by 240 runs and an innings . He concluded the tour with 80 runs in the final ODI game at Lahore. [ 35 ] In early 2007, Kohli was a part of the India U-19 team that toured New Zealand, where he scored 113 in the first Test match. The series ended in a draw. In the following month, the team travelled to Malaysia for a tri-series against England Under-19s and Sri Lanka Under-19s , where Kohli did not get many opportunities to bat. In July–August, India U-19 embarked on a tour for a tri-series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s , where he did not score a half-century in any of the matches. He made a comeback with scores of 144 and an unbeaten 94 in the following Test series. [ 36 ]\nKohli came into the limelight in 2008 when he led the team to victory in the U-19 World Cup. He led the Indian squad and won the 2008 U-19 World Cup held in Malaysia . [ 37 ] He amassed 235 runs at an average of 47, ranking as the tournament's third-highest scorer and one of three cricketers to compile a century. [ 38 ] His century, a knock of 100 runs off 74 balls, versus the West Indies Under-19s in a group stage encounter, was lauded by ESPNcricinfo , as \"the innings of the tournament.\" This innings paved the way for India's 50-run triumph and fetched Kohli the man of the match award. [ 39 ] Additionally, Kohli's all-round performance in the semi-final against New Zealand Under-19s , where he captured 2 wickets and contributed 43 runs in the run-chase , was core to India's victory. [ 40 ] In the championship match , Kohli managed a score of 19 against South Africa Under-19s and his contribution lead to the eventual 12-run win (via D/L method ). [ 41 ]\nIn June 2008, Kohli and his U-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border–Gavaskar scholarship. This scholarship, aimed at honing the skills of the chosen cricketers, provided an opportunity to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia 's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane. [ 42 ] In a bid to identify potential talent for the senior team, Kohli was selected to represent India Emerging Players in the Emerging Players Tournament 2008. His finest performance in the tournament was against New Zealand Emerging Players, where he played a knock of 120 runs, leading India to a seven-wicket victory. [ 43 ] With an aggregate of 204 runs, Kohli's performances did not go unnoticed by the selectors who were observing his progress. He began his international cricket journey by joining the senior team in Colombo , having played 28 Under-19 ODIs and 12 Under-19 Tests. [ 44 ]\nKohli's international career began in August 2008 when the 19-year-old had a \"surprise call-up\" to the ODI squad for a tour of Sri Lanka . [ 45 ] He opened the batting due to injuries to senior players, scoring his first half-century in the fourth match. [ 46 ] After a brief stint with the India A team , he scored a century against a strong Australian bowling line-up in a tour match. [ 47 ] Despite an early BCCI contract, Kohli's place in the team was not secure. A turning point came in the 2009 Emerging Players Tournament in Australia , where he was the top run-scorer, leading his team to victory with a century in the final. This performance cemented his return to the national side. [ 48 ] He scored his maiden ODI century in December 2009 against Sri Lanka . [ 49 ] By early 2010, he became the third Indian to score two ODI centuries before turning 22. [ 50 ]\nIn 2010, Kohli was appointed vice-captain for a tri-series in Zimbabwe and became the then fastest Indian to score 1,000 ODI runs. After a dip in form during the 2010 Asia Cup, he solidified his position with consistent performances, finishing as India's leading ODI run-scorer for the year. [ 51 ] Kohli played a crucial role in India's 2011 World Cup victory, scoring a century on his debut and a 35 in the final. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Further made his Test debut in June 2011 against the West Indies , but struggled initially and was dropped. [ 54 ] He was recalled and eventually found his footing, scoring his maiden Test century in Adelaide in January 2012. [ 55 ] He continued to score runs in ODIs, with an unbeaten 133 against Sri Lanka and a career-best 183 against Pakistan in the 2012 Asia Cup , being the standout performances. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]\nBy 2013, Kohli was a linchpin of the Indian batting line-up, particularly in run-chases. [ 58 ] He played a key role in India's 2013 Champions Trophy win [ 59 ] and was appointed captain for the first time during a tri-series in the West Indies , where he scored his first century as skipper. [ 60 ] He later established several records, including the fastest ODI century by an Indian. [ 61 ] After a difficult tour of England in 2014 where he averaged 13.4, [ 62 ] Kohli regained form and was named the full-time Test captain following MS Dhoni 's retirement during the tour of Australia . [ 63 ] In his first series as permanent captain, he scored three centuries in his first three innings, totaling 692 runs, the most by an Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia. [ 64 ] He also remained consistent in the T20 format, earning the Man of the Tournament award at the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 for his 319 runs in the tournament. [ 65 ]\nKohli's form in the lead-up to the World Cup was not at his best, however after a strong start to the 2015 World Cup with a century against Pakistan, [ 66 ] Kohli's tournament ended with a score of 1 in the semi-final loss to Australia . [ 67 ] A subsequent dip in form was followed by his first Test series win as captain in Sri Lanka. [ 68 ] From 2016 to 2018, he entered a peak phase of his career. [ 69 ] In 2016, he was the Player of the Tournament at the ICC World T20 . [ 70 ] He became the first batsman to score double centuries in four consecutive Test series and was appointed captain for the 2017 Champions Trophy , where India finished as runners-up. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] This period saw him break numerous records, including becoming the fastest to 8,000, 10,000, and 11,000 ODI runs. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] In 2018, he became the No. 1 ranked Test batsman and led India to first-ever Test series victory in Australia . [ 75 ] By 2019, he became India's most successful Test captain, holding the ICC Test Mace for three consecutive years. [ 76 ] He scored his 70th international century in November 2019, but this was followed by a prolonged lean patch. [ 77 ] From 2020 to 2022, Kohli struggled for runs and stepped down from the T20I, ODI, and Test captaincy in succession. [ 78 ]\nKohli's return to form began at the 2022 Asia Cup , where he scored his maiden T20I century, his first in any format in over 1,000 days. [ 79 ] He was the highest run-scorer at the 2022 T20 World Cup , playing an impactful innings of 82* against Pakistan. [ 80 ] His peak resurgence came at the 2023 World Cup on home soil where he was named the Player of the Tournament for scoring a record 765 runs in a single edition. During the tournament, he scored his 50th ODI hundred, surpassing Tendulkar 's long-standing record. [ 81 ] In next year's T20 World Cup ; Kohli had a lean tournament, however delivered a player of the match performance in the final , scoring 76 as India won the trophy. Following the victory, he announced his retirement from T20 Internationals. [ 82 ] In the 2025 Champions Trophy , Kohli was instrumental in India's victory, scoring a century and becoming the fastest to 14,000 ODI runs. [ 83 ] India later secured the title. On 12 May 2025, after poor Border-Gavaskar Trophy performances he announced that the Test-series would be his last, marking his retirement from Test cricket. [ 84 ]\nVirat Kohli scored his 54th ODI century against New Zealand in the third ODI at Indore, reaching the milestone in 91 balls with eight fours and two sixes while chasing a target of 337. With this innings, he became the leading century-maker against New Zealand with seven hundreds, surpassing Ricky Ponting and Virender Sehwag (six each), and Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya (five each). Kohli also became the highest run-scorer batting at number three. The century was his 85th in international cricket and his 41st on home soil. [ 85 ]\nIn the inaugural 2008 Indian Premier League season , Royal Challengers Bangalore, then owned by Vijay Mallya , acquired Kohli for $50,000 following his performances in the Under-19 World Cup . [ 86 ] Kohli managed one run in the opening match against Kolkata Knight Riders and initially struggled in the middle order. [ 87 ] A brief promotion to the top order in a match against the Deccan Chargers offered a glimpse of form, [ 88 ] but he soon returned to his original position. [ 89 ] He concluded the season with 165 runs, as Bangalore finished seventh in the league standings. [ 90 ] In the 2009 season , Kohli began with a series of low scores but found form with a half-century in the third match. [ 91 ] Despite limited opportunities, he made crucial contributions, notably in the semi-final victory over Chennai Super Kings . [ 92 ] However, he was dismissed for 7 in the final , as Bangalore lost to Deccan Chargers by eight runs, finishing as runners-up. [ 93 ]\nThe 2010 season saw Kohli elevated to the role of vice-captain. He emerged as a reliable middle-order batter and an athletic fielder, [ 94 ] with a notable 58 against the Deccan Chargers. [ 95 ] Bangalore reached the playoffs but were eliminated by Mumbai Indians in the semi-final, where Kohli was again dismissed for 7. [ 96 ] In the 2010 Champions League T20 , he delivered key performances, scoring 47 and 49* to help Bangalore reach the semi-finals before falling to Chennai. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Ahead of the 2011 season , Kohli was the sole player retained by Bangalore for $1.8 million. [ 99 ] After a steady start, he hit peak form with a string of impactful innings, including a half-century and consecutive Player of the Match awards. [ 100 ] He also stepped in as captain during Daniel Vettori ’s absence and earned praise for his leadership. [ 101 ] Bangalore topped the league table and advanced to the final , where Kohli contributed 35 runs in a losing cause. [ 102 ] He concluded the season with 557 runs, finishing as the second-highest run-scorer. [ 103 ]\nIn the 2012 IPL season , Kohli experienced an inconsistent run, [ 104 ] beginning with low scores before registering a few significant innings, [ 105 ] including an unbeaten 73 against Delhi Daredevils as part of a then-record 203-run partnership with Gayle . [ 106 ] Midway through the season, he assumed captaincy from Vettori [ 107 ] but could not guide Bangalore into the playoffs, with the team falling short in their final league match. [ 108 ] Kohli ended the campaign with 364 runs and expressed dissatisfaction with his performance, acknowledging the need for improvement. [ 109 ] Promoted to full-time captain from the 2013 season , [ 110 ] Kohli began with an unbeaten 93 and successive half-centuries, [ 111 ] [ 112 ] briefly taking his team to the top of the table. However, a mid-season slump, coupled with inconsistent bowling performances, [ 113 ] derailed their campaign. Despite Kohli's individual scores, including a 99-run innings, [ 114 ] Bangalore failed to qualify for the playoffs. Retained for ₹12.5 crore ahead of the 2014 season , [ 115 ] Kohli endured one of his most challenging campaigns. Although he began with an unbeaten 49, [ 116 ] his form deteriorated with a series of low scores and multiple ducks. [ 117 ] Attempts to revive his form by opening the innings proved ineffective, and he registered only a single half-century in his twelfth match. With Bangalore heavily dependent on Kohli and Gayle, the team lost six of their first nine matches and was eventually eliminated from playoff contention. [ 118 ] Kohli ended the season with a 73 against Chennai. [ 119 ]\nIn the 2015 season , Kohli opened the batting for Bangalore alongside Gayle and maintained consistent returns, scoring 505 runs in 16 matches at an average of 45.90. [ 120 ] His notable performances included an 82-run innings as part of a then-record 215-run partnership with AB de Villiers against Mumbai, [ 121 ] and an unbeaten 44 in a rain-shortened fixture against Hyderabad . [ 122 ] Under Kohli's captaincy, Bangalore reached the playoffs but were eliminated in Qualifier 2 by Chennai. The 2016 season marked a significant phase in Kohli's career. He began with a series of half-centuries [ 123 ] and registered his maiden T20 century against Gujarat . [ 124 ] Despite a slow start to the campaign, Bangalore staged a strong recovery, with Kohli scoring four centuries over the course of the tournament. [ 125 ] He finished the season with a record 973 runs at an average of 81.08, claiming both the Orange Cap and the Most Valuable Player award. [ 126 ] Bangalore reached the final but lost to Hyderabad by 8 runs. [ 127 ]\nAt the onset of 2017 season , Kohli missed the opening three matches due to a shoulder injury [ 128 ] but returned with a 62-run innings against Mumbai. [ 129 ] Despite adding a few more half-centuries, Bangalore endured a difficult campaign, including being dismissed for league record of 49 against Kolkata. Kohli cited the team's lack of intent and conservative approach as key concerns. [ 130 ] [ 131 ] Bangalore were eliminated early, finishing at the bottom of the table, [ 132 ] with Kohli scoring 308 runs in 10 innings. [ 133 ] That same year, he was named in ESPNcricinfo ’s all-time IPL XI as part of the league's tenth-anniversary recognitions. [ 134 ] Ahead of 2018, Kohli was retained for ₹17 crore , making him the most expensive player at the time. [ 135 ] He crossed the 500-run mark for a record fifth time and briefly held the Orange Cap, [ 136 ] but Bangalore failed to advance beyond the league stage. Heavy reliance on Kohli and de Villiers, alongside an underperforming bowling unit, contributed to their early exit. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] The 2019 season began with Kohli moving down the order, a tactical change that did not yield the desired results. [ 139 ] He later returned to form with a century [ 140 ] and finished the season with a series of improved performances, but Bangalore had lost their first six matches and again failed to reach the playoffs. [ 141 ] Kohli acknowledged the late improvement [ 142 ] but pointed to ongoing issues in the middle order, leading to increased scrutiny over his long captaincy tenure. [ 143 ]\nBetween 2020 and 2022, Kohli experienced mixed outcomes in the IPL. In the 2020 season , after a slow start, he delivered several steady innings that helped Bangalore qualify for the playoffs. [ 144 ] [ 145 ] However, his conservative strike rate [ 146 ] and early dismissal in the eliminator contributed to the team's exit. [ 147 ] In 2021 , he began positively and reached multiple individual milestones, including becoming the first player to play 200 matches for Bangalore [ 148 ] and surpassing 10,000 runs in T20 cricket. [ 149 ] Midway through the season, Kohli announced his decision to step down from captaincy at the end of the campaign. [ 150 ] Bangalore again reached the playoffs, but Kohli's dip in form coincided with the team's elimination. [ 151 ] In 2022 , under new captain Faf du Plessis , Kohli faced a prolonged lean patch, [ 152 ] recording multiple low scores and three ducks, which is the joint-highest in a single season of his career. [ 153 ] His struggles drew criticism from analysts and led to suggestions of taking a break from cricket. [ 154 ] He responded with a 73-run innings in a must-win match that secured Bangalore a place in the playoffs, [ 155 ] but failed to make a significant impact in the knockout games. The season concluded without a title, extending championship drought.\nIn the inaugural match of 2023 season , Kohli began with an unbeaten 82 against Mumbai [ 156 ] and maintained steady form, registering five half-centuries in the first eight matches. [ 157 ] His approach combined early aggression in the powerplay with a more measured tempo through the middle overs. [ 158 ] He also briefly captained the side in Faf du Plessis's absence. [ 159 ] Despite ending the season with back-to-back centuries, surpassing Gayle's record for most IPL hundreds. [ 160 ] [ 161 ] Bangalore failed to secure a playoff spot. Kohli concluded the campaign with 639 runs at an average of 53.2 and a strike rate of 140. Further in 2024 , Kohli played in rhythm, scoring several fifties [ 162 ] [ 163 ] and a career-best unbeaten 113 against Rajasthan, though it came in a defeat. [ 164 ] Bangalore recovered from a six-match losing streak with a six-match winning streak to enter the playoffs, with Kohli contributing significantly, [ 165 ] including a notable 92 off 47. [ 166 ] He ended the season with 741 runs at 61.75, earning the Orange Cap for the second time. [ 167 ] In the 2025 IPL season , Kohli scored 657 runs in 15 innings at an average of 54.75 and a strike rate of 146.5, finishing as the tournament's third-highest run-scorer. In the final against Punjab Kings, he contributed 43 runs off 35 balls as Bengaluru posted 190/9, eventually winning the match by six runs. The victory marked the franchise's first IPL title, ending an 18-year wait. It was also Kohli's first IPL championship in 18 seasons with the team. [ 168 ]\nKohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour. [ 169 ] [ 170 ] His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance, and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. [ 171 ] He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations. [ 172 ] [ 173 ] In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region. [ 174 ] [ 175 ] Kohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive , which he considers to be his signature stroke. He possesses a natural aptitude for the flick shot , particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg stump . [ 14 ] Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot , Kohli's batting technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on . [ 176 ] Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning. [ 177 ] Kohli is also a proficient fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes and sure-handedness. [ 178 ]\nHowever, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump . [ 179 ] Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches. [ 180 ] This vulnerability has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous occasions. [ 181 ] [ 182 ] Former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries. [ 183 ]\nKohli has garnered widespread acclaim and recognition as a preeminent limited-overs batter by cricketing experts and aficionados alike. [ 184 ] [ 185 ] In ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when batting second and 51.7 runs when batting first. [ 186 ] He has amassed 28 of his 51 ODI hundreds in run-chases, [ 187 ] and holds the record for the most hundreds scored when batting second. [ 188 ] In reference to his success while batting second, Kohli has expressed a fondness for the challenge of chasing, relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate his ability to efficiently manage strike rotation and execute boundary hits. [ 189 ] His colleagues admire his self-assurance, dedication, concentration, and work ethic, which are the driving forces behind his success. [ 190 ] [ 191 ]\nKohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field. He is known for his passionate and animated responses to on-field situations, demonstrating a fierce competitiveness. [ 192 ] [ 193 ] His captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking bold decisions and leading the team by example. [ 194 ] Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early stages of his career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions from fans, critics and former cricketers alike. [ 195 ] [ 196 ] While some have praised his assertiveness and confidence, [ 197 ] [ 198 ] others have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and for losing control, sometimes resulting in a loss of composure. [ 199 ] Despite his efforts to curb his aggressive behaviour, Kohli has acknowledged that there are times when intense pressure or high-stakes situations may challenge his resolve. Nevertheless, the cricketer has persistently maintained that his aggression acts as a source of inspiration and drives his focus and motivation on the field. [ 200 ] Writing for The New York Times , Huw Richards noted Kohli's self-assuredness and \"assertiveness\" in contrast to some former Indian cricketers who he felt had exhibited an inclination towards excessive politeness and reticence, and that Kohli embodies his combative demeanour both on and off the cricket field. [ 201 ] In contrast, former India captain Kapil Dev suggested Kohli's aggression was fake, saying Rohit Sharma \"doesn’t show fake aggression like Kohli.\" [ 202 ]\nKohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar , who he regarded as the epitome of excellence in cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's \"successor\", [ 203 ] [ 204 ] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future. [ 205 ] His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, who he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented. [ 206 ] Nevertheless, Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has notes that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots. [ 207 ]\nIn a discourse with Bollywood actor Salman Khan , Tendulkar proclaimed that Kohli possesses the potential to surpass his record of 100 international centuries. Tendulkar also acknowledged Kohli's batting aptitudes and the steadfastness with which he has accumulated runs. [ 208 ] In 2013, Tendulkar retired from international cricket, Kohli, who played alongside Tendulkar in the team, honoured him by presenting him with a sacred thread that had been gifted to him by his late father. Tendulkar eventually returned the thread to him, imploring that it should remain in his possession. [ 209 ]\nIn 2008, Kohli was approached by sports agent Bunty Sajdeh of Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment after his notable performance in the ICC Under-19 World Cup. Sajdeh was impressed with Kohli's leadership skills and attitude and saw great potential in the young cricketer. After being recommended by Yuvraj Singh, Kohli was signed to Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment. [ 210 ] Over the years, Kohli's brand endorsement portfolio has experienced significant growth. In 2013, it was reported that his endorsements were valued at over ₹ 100 crore (US$12 million). [ 211 ] Now in 2023, his brand value has reached ₹ 1,000 crore (US$120 million). [ 212 ] His bat deal with MRF is regarded as one of the most financially rewarding deals in cricket history. [ 213 ] In 2017, Kohli entered into a notable endorsement agreement with Puma that spanned over eight years and was estimated to be worth around ₹ 1.1 billion (US$13 million). This deal made Kohli the first Indian athlete to sign a brand endorsement contract valued at ₹ 100 crore (US$12 million) deal with a brand. [ 214 ] As of January 2023 [update] , Kohli is widely regarded as the most marketable cricketer, with annual earnings estimated at ₹ 165 crore (US$20 million). [ 215 ] Kohli is currently recognized as the most followed Asian individual on the social media platform Instagram , boasting over 274 million followers on the platform. Reports indicate that he is able to command a fee of ₹ 8.9 crore (equivalent to ₹ 9.4 crore or US$1.1 million in 2023) for each sponsored post on the platform. [ 216 ]\nKohli has gained international acclaim for his athletic achievements and widespread popularity, earning a prominent place among the world's most renowned athletes, as per ESPN . [ 217 ] In 2014, American Appraisal conducted an evaluation of Kohli's brand value and determined it to be $56.4 million, placing him fourth on the list of India's most valued celebrity brands. [ 218 ] The following two years saw Kohli's brand value soar higher. As per a report published in October 2016 by Duff & Phelps , Kohli's brand worth had increased to $92 million, second only to that of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan . [ 219 ] In 2017, Kohli was recognized by Forbes as the seventh \"Most Valuable Brand among Athletes\", surpassing renowned sports figures such as Lionel Messi , Rory McIlroy , and Stephen Curry , with a brand estimation of $14.5 million. [ 220 ] By September of the same year, Kohli had amassed endorsement agreements with 17 distinct brands, and he announced that he would only endorse products that he personally uses and believes in. [ 221 ] The following year, he was featured on Time magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world . [ 222 ] In 2019, Kohli was the only cricketer included in Forbes' list of \"World's 100 Highest-Paid Athletes\". He was ranked 100th on the list, with earnings estimated at $25 million, with $21 million being procured through endorsements, and the remainder from salary and tournament winnings. [ 223 ] Furthermore, in March 2019, Kohli was named the brand ambassador of the mobile esports platform, Mobile Premier League . [ 224 ] Kohli's earning potential continued to climb, and in 2020, he attained the 66th spot in Forbes compilation of the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the world for the year 2020 , with estimated earnings exceeding $26 million. [ 225 ] In April 2021, Vivo appointed Kohli as their brand ambassador ahead of the Indian Premier League. [ 226 ]\nIn 2012, Kohli was recognized as one of the best-dressed men by the fashion magazine GQ , appearing on their annual list alongside figures such as Barack Obama . [ 210 ] Six years later, in 2018, a documentary highlighting Kohli's cricketing career was released on National Geographic channel. The film aimed to celebrate his accomplishments in the sport. [ 227 ] The following year, on the eve of the 2019 Cricket World Cup a tribute was bestowed upon Kohli. Madame Tussauds renowned for their lifelike wax figures, unveiled an exquisite creation of Kohli in London. [ 228 ] Continuing the string of accolades, in 2019, on the eleventh anniversary of his international debut, Kohli was honoured with a stand named after him at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in Delhi, making him the youngest cricketer to receive such a recognition. [ 229 ] In November of the same year, an Indian animated superhero television series entitled Super V premiered, featuring a fictionalized portrayal of Kohli's teenage years and his discovery of superpowers. [ 230 ]\nKohli's romantic association with Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma , which commenced in 2013, earned the duo the moniker of \"Virushka\". [ 231 ] During an interview with Graham Bensinger , Kohli divulged that he had encountered Sharma for the first time, when they were both were engaged in a promotional shoot for Clear shampoo . [ 232 ] Their union since then has attracted significant media interest, with persistent rumours and speculations swirling around in the press, as both parties remained reticent about publicly discussing the relationship. [ 233 ] On 11 December 2017, the couple exchanged nuptials in an intimate ceremony held in Florence , Italy , becoming one of the most talked-about celebrity couples in the country. [ 234 ] On 11 January 2021, the couple had their first child, a daughter, who was named Vamika. [ 235 ] On 15 February 2024, the couple welcomed their second child, a son named Akaay. [ 236 ]\nIn 2018, Kohli disclosed that he had made the decision to adopt a vegetarian diet in an effort to alleviate the symptoms of a cervical spine issue caused by elevated levels of uric acid . This condition was impacting his finger movements, and thus, affecting his performance as a batsman. He made a conscious effort to abstain from consuming meat, as part of his regimen for maintaining optimal health. [ 237 ] He has since clarified that his dietary choices do not align with a vegan lifestyle and he continues to consume dairy products. [ 238 ] Kohli is widely recognized for his physical fitness and intense training regimen. [ 239 ] He has been an advocate of leading a healthy lifestyle, which involves regular exercise and a nutritious diet. His hard work and discipline in this area have earned him the reputation of being one of the fittest cricketers in the world. [ 240 ]\nKohli has acknowledged a belief in superstitions, and owns various lucky charms and rituals that he feels bring him good fortune on the cricket field. This includes wearing of black wristband and a single pair of gloves. [ 241 ] Furthermore, Kohli has been observed sporting a kara , a traditional bangle often worn for religious or spiritual purposes, on his right arm since 2012.

[ 11 ] In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman , and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards . [ 12 ] The same year, Tendulkar was a part of the team that was one of the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy . Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup , his first win in six World Cup appearances for India. [ 13 ] He had previously been named \"Player of the Tournament\" at the 2003 World Cup .\nTendulkar has received several awards from the government of India : the Arjuna Award (1994), the Khel Ratna Award (1997), the Padma Shri (1998), and the Padma Vibhushan (2008). [ 14 ] [ 15 ] After Tendulkar played his last match in November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna , India's highest civilian award. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] He was the first sportsperson to receive the award and, as of 2024 [update] , is the youngest recipient. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Having retired from ODI cricket in 2012, [ 21 ] [ 22 ] he retired from all forms of cricket in November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match . [ 23 ] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs. [ 24 ] In 2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test World XI to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack , and he was one of only two specialist batsmen of the post– World War II era, along with Viv Richards , to get featured in the team. [ 25 ]\nTendulkar is regarded as a symbol of national pride in India for his achievements. In 2010, Time included Tendulkar in its annual list of the most influential people in the world . [ 26 ] Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010 International Cricket Council (ICC) Awards . [ 27 ] In 2019, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame . [ 28 ]\nTendulkar was born at the Nirmal Nursing Home in the Dadar neighbourhood of Bombay, Maharashtra on 24 April 1973 [ 29 ] [ 30 ] into a Maharastrian family. [ 31 ] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar , was a Marathi-language novelist and poet while his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry. [ 32 ] Tendulkar's father named him after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman . [ 33 ] Tendulkar has three older siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were his father's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] His brother Ajit played in Bombay's Kanga Cricket League . [ 36 ]\nTendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East) . As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully , and he often picked fights with new children in his school. [ 37 ]\nAs a child, Tendulkar was interested in both tennis and cricket. [ 38 ] He particularly idolised American player John McEnroe , and emulated his hero by growing his hair long at the age of 7 or 8 years. At this time, Tendulkar also regularly wore tennis wristbands and headbands and carried a tennis racquet with him as a sign of his love for tennis. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]\nTo help curb his bullying tendencies, his elder brother Ajit introduced Tendulkar to cricket in 1984. Ajit introduced him to cricket coach Ramakant Achrekar at Shivaji Park in Dadar. At their first meeting, Tendulkar did not play well. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Tendulkar, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy. [ 42 ] [ better source needed ]\nAchrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir School, [ 29 ] a school in Dadar that had produced many notable cricketers. He made his debut as a cricketer for Sharadashram in late 1984. [ 43 ] Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East). [ 43 ] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings. [ 44 ] Tendulkar would practice for hours; if he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps , and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar completed the session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar considers the 13 coins he won among his most prized possessions. [ 45 ] While he was training at Shivaji Park, he moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near the park. [ 43 ]\nBesides school cricket, Tendulkar also played club cricket . In 1984, at age 11, he debuted in the Kanga Cricket League while playing for the John Bright Cricket Club. [ 43 ] [ 46 ] Beginning in 1988, he played for the Cricket Club of India . [ 46 ] [ 47 ]\nIn 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai ) to train as a fast bowler , but the trainer, Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee , was unimpressed and suggested that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead. [ 48 ] On 20 January 1987, he was a substitute for Imran Khan 's side in an exhibition match at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay. [ 49 ] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave Tendulkar a pair of his own lightweight pads and told him to not get disheartened for not receiving the Bombay Cricket Association 's Best Junior Cricketer Award. Of this experience, Tendulkar later said, \"It was the greatest source of encouragement for me\". [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Tendulkar served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay. [ 52 ] [ 53 ]\nIn 1988, while playing for Sharadashram, Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli batted in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School. Tendulkar scored 326 ( not out ) in that match and scored over 1,000 runs in the tournament. [ 54 ] This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two junior cricketers in Hyderabad, India . [ 55 ]\nOn 14 November 1987, at age 14, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy for the 1987–88 season , but he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder . [ 43 ] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at Wankhede Stadium and scored 100 ( not out ) in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket . [ 56 ] He was selected to play for the team by Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar , who watched him play Kapil Dev in Wankhede Stadium's cricket practice nets , [ 29 ] where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team . Tendulkar followed this by scoring a century each in his Deodhar and Duleep Trophy debuts, which are also India's domestic cricket tournaments. [ 57 ]\nTendulkar finished the 1988–89 Ranji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77 and was the eighth-highest run-scorer overall. [ 58 ] In both 1988 and 1989, he was picked for a young Indian team to tour England under the Star Cricket Club banner. [ 59 ] In the 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, which Bombay narrowly lost to Haryana , Tendulkar's 96 from 75 balls was key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day. [ 60 ]\nAt the start of the 1989–90 season, while playing for Rest of India , Tendulkar scored an unbeaten century in an Irani Trophy match against Delhi . [ 61 ]\nIn the final of 1995 Ranji Trophy , Tendulkar, captaining Bombay, scored 140 and 139 versus Punjab . [ 62 ]\nIn the 1995–96 Irani Cup, he captained Mumbai against Rest of India . [ 62 ] His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998. [ 29 ] [ 63 ] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies). [ 64 ] Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy , which he regards as one of the best innings of his career. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ]\nIn total, Tendulkar was part of five Ranji Trophy finals, in which Mumbai won 4. [ 62 ]\nIn 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire , which, prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players, even UK -based, from outside Yorkshire . [ 29 ] [ Note 1 ] Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott , Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the team and scored 1,070 runs at an average of 46.52. [ 68 ]\nRaj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989 , [ 69 ] after one first class season. [ 70 ] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. [ citation needed ]\nTendulkar was the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days, he made his ODI debut for India at the age of 16 years and 238 days, playing against Pakistan in Gujranwala. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He scored 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis , who also made his debut in that match. He was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack. [ 73 ] In the fourth and final Test match in Sialkot , he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he his nose gushed blood. [ 74 ] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar , held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs bowled by leg-spinner Abdul Qadir . [ 75 ] This was later called \"one of the best innings I have seen\" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth . [ 76 ] In all, Tendulkar scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played. [ 77 ] [ 78 ]\nThe series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests. [ 79 ] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two ODI games he played, and scored 36 in the other. [ 80 ] On a 1990 tour to England, on 14 August, he became the second-youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester. [ 74 ] Wisden described his innings as \"a disciplined display of immense maturity\" and also wrote, \"He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar , and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen\". [ 81 ]\nTendulkar's reputation grew during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup . During the tour, he scored an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney , making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack from Merv Hughes , Bruce Reid , and Craig McDermott . Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that \"This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB.\" [ 82 ]\nTendulkar opened the batting for the first time in ODIs at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, scoring an explosive 82 runs off just 49 balls. [ 83 ] This was an innings hailed by Wisden as one that “changed ODI cricket forever.” [ 84 ] He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo , in his 79th ODI. [ 85 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ]\nTendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup with 523 runs, scoring two centuries and three fifties. [ 88 ] He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri Lanka, scoring 65 runs out of 120 for India. [ 89 ] Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse [ 89 ] and the match referee, Clive Lloyd , awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field. [ 90 ]\nAfter the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah , Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat. [ citation needed ] Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over. [ 91 ] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI. [ 92 ]\nTendulkar scored 143 (131) runs in Sharjah against the Australian team in the 1998 Coca-Cola cup , including 5 sixes in an innings against Shane Warne , Damien Fleming and Michael Kasprowicz . The innings is known as the \"Desert Storm\" because it was interrupted by a sand storm . In 2020, a poll from the ICC declared it Tendulkar's best ODI innings. [ 93 ]\nIn early 1998, when Australia toured India, Tendulkar scored 155*, 79 and 177 in 3 consecutive innings. [ 94 ] The focus of the tour was the clash between Tendulkar and spinner Shane Warne , both at the peak of their careers. [ 95 ] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan . [ 96 ] In their tour opener, Australia faced Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match. [ 97 ] Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 204 runs as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days. [ 98 ] [ 99 ] Tendulkar dominated Warne in the test series. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Tendulkar finished with 446 runs at an average of 111.50 and conceded his wicket to Warne only once on five occasions. Warne on the other hand took ten wickets in the series but they cost him 54 runs apiece. [ 101 ] Tendulkar was chosen as the player of the series, [ 102 ] with India winning the series 2-1. [ 103 ]\nTendulkar also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi . Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan , Steve Waugh , Darren Lehmann , Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs. [ 104 ] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah—the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings. [ 105 ] Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis. [ 106 ]\nTendulkar's great all-round performance in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls. [ 107 ] He was declared the player of the match. [ 108 ]\nThe inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999 , involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. [ 109 ] Around 100,000 attended the first four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record. [ 110 ] In the first match, between India and Pakistan at Eden Gardens , Tendulkar was dismissed from the match after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar . The crowd reacted by throwing objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200 people. [ 111 ] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka. [ 112 ] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate in the 2001–02 Asian Test Championship due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan . [ 113 ]\nIn a Test match against Pakistan at Chepauk (Chennai) in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Tendulkar scored 136 runs on a deteriorating track against a strong Pakistan attack comprising Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Saqlain Mushtaq and a young Shahid Afridi, while battling back spams. [ 114 ] India however lost the match by 12 runs as the last 3 wickets fell for just 4 runs. [ 115 ] Wisden: \"This innings was voted No.5 in Wisden’s Test innings of the decade in our 1990s in Review series\". [ 116 ]\nTendulkar's father, Ramesh Tendulkar, died during the 1999 Cricket World Cup . Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe . [ 117 ] He returned to the World Cup, scoring a century (140 not out of 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in Bristol. He dedicated the century to his father. [ 118 ]\nTendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. Tendulkar became captain in 1996, but by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Discussing Tendulkar's first term as captain, Azharuddin was credited with saying, \"He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!\" ( Hindi : \"Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!\" ) [ 121 ] [ 122 ]\nTendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions. [ when? ] [ 123 ] Tendulkar won the player of the series award, [ 123 ] as well as player of the match in one of the games. [ 124 ] After another Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000. [ 125 ] [ 126 ]\nIn 2000, members of the South African national team attempted to fix matches during their visit to India. After the incident, Tendulkar and three other senior cricketers worked to ensure that players \"whose performance and conduct was dubious were never picked for the Indian squad again\". [ 127 ]\nDuring the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known. Then Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President Sharad Pawar offered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni . Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for suggesting Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain. [ 128 ]\nDuring India's 2001 tour of South Africa, in the second Test match, referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing, and fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team. [ 129 ] Denness suspended Tendulkar from one match for alleged ball tampering . Television cameras captured images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball. [ 130 ] [ 131 ] The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism, [ 132 ] and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee. [ 133 ] The charges against Tendulkar triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public. [ 134 ]\nWhen Australia toured India in 2001, in the first test at Mumbai , Tendulkar scored 76 and 65, with no one else from India crossing 50. [ 135 ] India ended up losing the test. On the final day of the 2nd test, the famous Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001 , Tendulkar took three wickets, including the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist , who were centurions in the previous Test. His three wickets haul helped India win the match. [ 136 ] In the 3rd test at Chennai , Tendulkar top scored for India with 126 helping the team to get to a total of 501. [ 137 ] India would go on to win the test match narrowly by just 2 wickets and clinch the test series 2-1. [ 138 ] This series is regarded as one of the greatest series of the century. [ 139 ]\nIn the five-match ODI series that followed, Tendulkar once again had a successful series scoring 280 runs at an average of 56 and strike rate of 120.17. [ 140 ] He also took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa . [ 141 ]\nIn the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test. In the second Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his 93rd Test match, to equal Donald Bradman 's record of 29 Test hundreds. He was gifted a Ferrari 360 Modena by Fiat through Michael Schumacher for achieving this feat. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] Then, in an unprecedented sequence, he scored just 0, 0, 8, and 0 in the next four innings. [ 145 ] He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86, one half century. However, India lost the series. [ 146 ]\nTendulkar had a successful series in England in 2002, scoring 401 runs in 6 innings at an average of 66.83. [ 147 ] In the third Test match of this series in August 2002 at Headingley , Leeds , Tendulkar scored his 30th Test century (193) to surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match. [ 148 ] [ 149 ] India won this test match and the 4-match series ended up drawn 1-1. [ 150 ]\nTendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup , [ 151 ] helping India reach the final. While Australia won, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award. [ 152 ] [ 153 ]\nHe continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving New Zealand and Australia. [ 154 ] [ 155 ] As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden, in the tri-series final. [ 156 ]\nThe drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, scoring 241 not out from 436 balls with 33 fours at a strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney , putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He spent 613 minutes at the crease during the innings. He followed this up with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test. [ 157 ] Prior to this Test match, he had scored only 82 runs in 5 innings in the first 3 tests of the series. [ 158 ] It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.00 and just one fifty. [ 159 ]\nTendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests. [ 160 ] Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise. [ 161 ] Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste. [ 162 ] [ 163 ] After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest. [ 164 ]\nA tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004. [ 165 ] [ 166 ] He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with an attacking 55, though Australia took the series 2–1. [ 167 ]\nOn 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla , Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans . After this, Tendulkar endured the longest [ needs update ] spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007. [ 168 ] Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan. [ 169 ] He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006, [ 170 ] and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory. [ 171 ] On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede , Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd. [ 172 ] Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity. [ citation needed ]\nTendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century. [ 173 ] Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method . [ 174 ]\nDuring the preparation for the 2007 World Cup , Tendulkar's attitude was criticised by Indian coach Greg Chappell . Chappell reportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while Tendulkar felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career. [ 175 ] Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances. In a rare show of emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach had ever suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect. On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media. [ 176 ] Chappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no bearing on his decision and that he and Tendulkar were on good terms. [ 175 ]\nAt the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team led by Rahul Dravid had a dismal campaign. Tendulkar, who was pushed to bat lower down the order had scores of 7 against Bangladesh , 57 not out against Bermuda and 0 against Sri Lanka . [ 177 ] [ 178 ] [ 179 ] As a result, former Australian captain Ian Chappell , brother of Greg, called for Tendulkar to retire in his newspaper column. [ 180 ]\nAfter the loss against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, Tendulkar suffered depression and thought to retire from cricket, but Viv Richards and Ajit Tendulkar stopped him. According to Tendulkar, 23 March 2007, the loss against Bangladesh is one of the worst days of his cricketing career. [ 181 ]\nIn 2007, in a Test series during India's tour of Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the Man of the Series. [ 182 ] He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the Future Cup against South Africa. During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in ODIs. [ 183 ] He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series. [ 184 ] [ 185 ]\nOn the second day of the Nottingham Test on 28 July 2007, Tendulkar became the third cricketer to complete 11,000 Test runs. [ 186 ] In the subsequent one-day series against England, Tendulkar was the leading run scorer from India [ 187 ] with an average of 53.42. In the ODI Series against Australia in October 2007 Tendulkar was the leading Indian run scorer with 278 runs. [ 188 ]\nTendulkar was dismissed five times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some to suggestions that he struggles to cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings. [ 189 ] Tendulkar has got out 27 times in the 90s during his international career. [ 190 ] In a five-ODI series against Pakistan, he was caught by Kamran Akmal off the bowling of Umar Gul for 99 in the second match at Mohali , [ 191 ] and in the fourth match of that series, he got out in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before dragging a delivery from Gul on to his stumps. [ 192 ]\nIn 2008 India's tour of Australia, at a Sydney Test match, Australian Andrew Symonds accused Indian Harbhajan Singh of using racist terminology by calling him a monkey. This matter was dubbed \" Monkeygate \" by the media. [ 193 ] Singh was suspended by the match ICC referee after a hearing. Sachin Tendulkar was standing at the non-striker's end at the moment when Symonds claimed the racist comments were made. In the hearing, Tendulkar said to the ICC match referee Mike Procter , that he could not say what exactly Singh said to Symonds, but in the next hearing, Tendulkar changed his stance and said that Symonds had not said \"monkey\" but \" Teri Maa Ki... \" ('Your mother's...'). In his autobiography Playing It My Way , Tendulkar wrote, \" Teri Maa Ki... , It is an expression we often use in North India to vent our anger and to me it all part of the game\". [ full citation needed ] The matter became big in the following days and nearly led to the cancellation of this tour. [ 194 ] The referee suspended Singh for 3 Tests but after appeal and Tendulkar's statement in the hearing the suspension was overturned. Andrew Symonds later said in Monkeygate- Ten years on , a documentary that was based on this matter, \"When I began to play for Mumbai Indians, IPL franchise, once Harbhajan Singh came to me and apologised.\" Symonds said in the documentary, \"We go to a very wealthy man's place for a barbecue, drinks, and dinner one night, and the whole team's there, and he had guests there, and Harbhajan said 'mate, can I speak to you for a minute out in the garden out the front?' He goes, 'look, I've got to say sorry to you for what I did to you in Sydney. I apologise.\" [ 195 ] [ 194 ] The Herald Sun stated that Tendulkar is still not \"forgiven\" by some Aussie players for changing his account on Monkeygate, dubbing Tendulkar an Indian \" demigod \". [ 196 ] [ 197 ]\nIn the Border–Gavaskar Trophy, 2007–08 , Tendulkar showed exceptional form, becoming the leading run scorer with \"493 runs in four Tests, despite consistently failing in the second innings. [ 198 ] Tendulkar scored 62 runs in the first innings of the first Test at the MCG in Melbourne , but could not prevent a heavy 337-run win for Australia. [ 199 ] In the controversial New Years' Test at Sydney , Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 154, even though India lost the Test. This was his third century at the SCG and his 38th Test century overall, earning him an average of 326 at the ground at the time of completing the innings. [ 200 ] [ 201 ] In the third Test at the WACA cricket ground in Perth , Tendulkar was instrumental in India's first innings score of 330, scoring a well-compiled 71. India went on to record a historic triumph at the WACA, ending Australia's run of 16 consecutive wins. [ 202 ] In the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval , which ended in a draw, he scored 153 in the first innings, being involved in a crucial 126-run stand with VVS Laxman for the fifth wicket to lead India to a score of 282 for 5 from 156 for 4. [ 203 ] He secured the Man of the Match award. [ 204 ]\nIn the One-Day International Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series involving India, Sri Lanka and Australia, Tendulkar became the only batsman to complete 16,000 runs in ODIs. [ 205 ] He achieved this feat against Sri Lanka on 5 February 2008 at the Gabba in Brisbane . He started the series with scores of 10, 35, 44 and 32. [ 206 ] His form dipped a bit in the middle of the tournament with scores of 5,0 and 2, but Tendulkar came back strongly in India's must-win game against Sri Lanka at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart , scoring 63 off 54 balls. [ 207 ] He finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120 balls in the first final, [ 208 ] and 91 runs in the second final. [ 209 ] Both the knocks were nominated to be the ODI Batting Performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo. [ 210 ]\nSouth Africa toured in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series. Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series; [ 211 ] he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia Cup , and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL . [ 212 ]\nBefore the Indian cricket team's tour of Sri Lanka in July 2008, Tendulkar needed 177 runs to go past Brian Lara's record of Test 11,953 runs. However, he failed in all six innings, scoring a total of 95 runs. India lost the series and his average of 15.83 was his worst in a Test series with at least three matches. [ 213 ]\nIn the following ODI series against Sri Lanka, Tendulkar was sidelined due to injury. [ 214 ] However, during the following Australia tour of India, he returned to fitness and form, scoring 13 and 49 in the first Test [ 215 ] before making 88 in the first innings of the second Test, breaking the record for most Test runs held by Brian Lara. He also reached the 12,000-run mark when he was on 61. [ 216 ] [ 217 ] He described the achievement as the biggest in 19 years of his career on the day he achieved the record. [ 218 ] He made a fifty in the third Test [ 219 ] and 109 in the fourth, as India won the series 2–0 and regained the Border–Gavaskar Trophy. [ 220 ]\nTendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at home against England due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI [ 221 ] and 50 in the fifth, [ 222 ] before the series was called off due to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks , the scoreline being 5–0 to India. [ 223 ] [ 224 ]\nEngland returned for a two-match Test series in December 2008, and the first Test, which was originally planned to be held in Mumbai, was shifted to Chennai following the terror attacks. [ 223 ] [ 224 ] Chasing 387 for victory in that match, Tendulkar scored 103 not out and shared a 163-run unbroken fifth wicket partnership with Yuvraj Singh . [ 225 ] This was his third century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and the first which resulted in a win. [ 226 ] He dedicated this century to the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks. [ 227 ] The knock was nominated to be one of the Test Batting Performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo. [ 228 ] Tendulkar called this his most meaningful knock. [ 229 ] Tendulkar scored poorly in the second Test at Mohali , which ended in a draw. India won the series 1–0. [ 230 ]\nIn early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai. [ 231 ] Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two matches. [ 232 ]\nIndia's next assignment was an away series against New Zealand, consisting of three Tests and five ODIs. In the ODI series, Tendulkar made an unbeaten 163 in the third match before stomach cramps forced him to end his innings. India made 392, won the match [ 233 ] and eventually won the series 3–1. [ 234 ] Tendulkar made 160 in the first Test, his 42nd Test century, and India won. [ 235 ] He made 49 and 64 in the second Test [ 236 ] and 62 and 9 in the third, in which play was halted on the last day due to rain with India needing only two wickets to win. India won the series 1–0. [ 237 ] [ 238 ]\nTendulkar rested himself for the ODI tour of West Indies, [ 239 ] but was back for the Compaq Cup Tri Series between India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand in early September 2009. He made 46 [ 240 ] and 27 [ 241 ] in the league matches before notching up 138 in the final, as India made 319 and won by 46 runs. [ 242 ] This was Tendulkar's sixth century in a final of an ODI tournament and his third consecutive score of over 50 in such finals. [ 243 ]\nTendulkar played only one innings in the ICC Champions trophy in South Africa, scoring 8 against Pakistan as India lost. [ 244 ] The next match against Australia was abandoned due to rain [ 245 ] and he was out with a stomach infection in the third match against the West Indies, as India were eliminated. [ 246 ]\nAustralia returned for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 in the first four games. [ 247 ] In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs. [ 248 ] Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just when it seemed that he would steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler Clint McKay over short fine leg only to be caught by Nathan Hauritz , with India needing 19 runs to win with 18 balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and Australia won the match by three runs. [ 249 ] [ 250 ] During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs, [ 250 ] [ 251 ] and achieved his personal best against Australia, [ 252 ] as well as the third-highest score in a defeat. [ 253 ] The knock was voted as the Best ODI Batting Performance of 2009 by ESPNcricinfo. [ 254 ]\nIn the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in 2009–10, Tendulkar scored 69, 43, 96 not out and 8 in the first four matches, [ 255 ] with the fifth match being abandoned as the pitch was deemed unfit and potentially dangerous. [ 256 ] India won the series 3–1. [ 257 ] In the Test series that followed, he scored a 100 not out in the first Test, which was drawn, and 40 and 53 in the second and third Tests, respectively, as India clinched innings victories in both the Tests, to win the series 2–0. [ 258 ]\nTendulkar rested himself for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010, but played in the subsequent Test series. [ 259 ] He made 105 not out and 16 in the first Test, and 143 in the second. India won both the Tests. [ 260 ] [ 261 ]\nIn the two-Test Series against South Africa , Tendulkar made 7 and 100 in the first Test. [ 262 ] He then scored 106 in the first innings of the second Test, which was his 47th hundred in Test cricket. It was also his fourth hundred in successive Tests, and he was the fourth Indian to achieve this feat. [ 263 ] [ 264 ] In the second match of the subsequent ODI series, Tendulkar scored 200 not out, becoming the world's first batsman to score a double century in ODI cricket and breaking the previous highest score of 194 jointly held by Pakistan's Saeed Anwar and Zimbabwe's Charles Coventry . [ Note 2 ]\nFrom February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup . Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries, Tendulkar was India's leading run-scorer for the tournament; only Tillakaratne Dilshan of Sri Lanka scored more runs, [ 270 ] and was named in the ICC \"Team of the Tournament\". [ 271 ] India defeated Sri Lanka in the final. [ 272 ] Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that \"Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. ... I couldn't control my tears of joy.\" [ 273 ]\nIndia were due to tour the West Indies in June, although Tendulkar chose not to participate. He returned to the squad in July for India's tour of England . [ 274 ] Throughout the tour there was much hype in the media about whether Tendulkar would reach his 100th century in international cricket (Test and ODIs combined). However, his highest score in the Tests was 91; Tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed India as the No. 1 ranked Test side. [ 275 ] [ 276 ] The injury Tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the ODI series that followed. [ 275 ] Tendulkar created another record on 8 November 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket, during the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi. [ 277 ] [ 278 ] For his performances in 2011, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC. [ 279 ]\nIan Chappell was not happy with Tendulkar's performance after India's tour of Australia. He says that Tendulkar's quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance on the Tour of Australia. [ 280 ] Former India World Cup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced his opinion that Tendulkar should have retired from ODI's after the World Cup. [ 281 ] Former Australian fast bowler, Geoff Lawson, has said that Tendulkar has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar should not delay it for too long. [ 282 ] The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Tendulkar in the national Test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing in August 2012. [ 283 ]\nOn 16 March 2012, Tendulkar accomplished a remarkable feat by scoring his 100th international century in a match against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup, held at Mirpur. [ 284 ] This was a pioneering achievement, as he became the first cricketer to ever reach this landmark. [ 285 ] This century was not just a momentous occasion for Tendulkar, but it was also his first ODl century against Bangladesh. Despite the widespread media attention and public fascination with this milestone, Tendulkar confessed that it was a challenging time for him, as the constant focus on his 100th hundred became a mentally onerous task. [ 286 ] [ 287 ] Despite Tendulkar's illustrious century, India was unable to secure a triumph against Bangladesh, resulting in a defeat by a margin of 5 wickets. [ 288 ]\nAfter being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home. [ 289 ] In a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012. This was his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009. He scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one. [ 290 ]\nHowever, because of a poor form in the first two Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012, [ 291 ] some people have started to question his place in the Indian team. A report by The Hindustan Times said that Tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector Sandeep Patil , in which he said that he would leave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs. [ 292 ] This speculation, however, was later considered to be false. [ 293 ] [ 294 ]\nThen he decided to play in the knockout stage of the 2012–13 Ranji Trophy . He scored 108 in the quarter-final against Baroda before being bowled by Murtuja Vahora , where Tendulkar was involved in a 234-run partnership with opener Wasim Jaffer (150) for the 3rd wicket at Wankhede Stadium . [ 295 ] Mumbai eventually piled on 645/9 and won on 1st innings lead. [ 296 ] In the semi-final against Services at Palam A Ground, with Mumbai reeling at 23/3, Tendulkar scored 56 from 75 balls and had an 81-run 4th wicket partnership with Abhishek Nayar (70), [ 297 ] and Mumbai eventually won on 1st innings lead after the match went into the sixth day due to rain delays. [ 298 ] In the final against Saurashtra , he was run out for 22 following a misunderstanding with Wasim Jaffer . [ 299 ] Mumbai eventually won the Ranji Trophy 2012–13. [ 300 ]\nHe also played in the Irani Trophy for Mumbai, where he scored 140* against Rest of India and helped Mumbai to score 409 in reply to Rest of India's 526. This was also his 81st hundred in first-class cricket, equalling Sunil Gavaskar 's Indian record for most first-class hundreds. [ 301 ]\nAfter a series of underwhelming performances during the 2012 series against England, Tendulkar announced his departure from One Day International cricket on 23 December 2012. However, he stated that he would continue to be available for representation in the Test format of the sport. [ 302 ] [ 303 ] Upon the announcement of his retirement from One Day International cricket, former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly expressed his surprise, noting that Tendulkar could have still participated in the upcoming series against Pakistan. Anil Kumble reflected on the difficulty of imagining an Indian ODI team without Tendulkar's name, while Javagal Srinath acknowledged the transformative impact Tendulkar had on the game, starting from the time he debuted as an opener in New Zealand in 1994. [ 304 ]\nAfter playing a Twenty20 International in 2006 against South Africa, he said that he would not play the format again. [ 305 ] He announced his retirement from the IPL after his team, Mumbai Indians , beat Chennai Super Kings by 23 runs at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 26 May to win the Indian Premier League 2013 . [ 306 ] He retired from Twenty20 cricket and limited-overs cricket, after playing the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 in September–October 2013 in India for Mumbai Indians. [ 307 ]\nOn 10 October 2013 Tendulkar announced that he would retire from all cricket after the two-Test series against West Indies in November . [ 308 ] [ 309 ] At his request, the BCCI arranged that the two matches be played at Kolkata and Mumbai so that the farewell would happen at his home ground. [ 310 ] [ 311 ] He scored 74 runs in his last Test innings against West Indies, thus failing short by 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in Test cricket, the next man to bat after him was the future captain Virat Kohli . [ 23 ] [ 312 ] The Cricket Association of Bengal and the Mumbai Cricket Association organised events to mark his retirement from the sport. [ 313 ] [ 314 ] Various national and international figures from cricket, politics, Bollywood and other fields spoke about him in a day-long Salaam Sachin Conclave organised by India Today . [ 315 ] [ 316 ]\nIn July 2014, he captained the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's . [ 317 ] In December 2014, he was announced ambassador of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 event. [ 318 ] [ 319 ] It is his second term as he has already held the ambassador of the previous ICC Cricket World Cup 2011. [ 320 ] He got the ambassador position of the ICC Cricket world cup in consecutive terms of the cricket world cup (2011 and 2015).\nTendulkar organised exhibition cricket matches in partnership with former Aussie cricketer Shane Warne . Cricket All-Stars held in US in baseball stadiums and had retired players, some of them was Sourav Ganguly, Shoaib Akhtar , Wasim Akram . [ 321 ]\nOn 8 February 2020, he played in the Bushfire Cricket Bash , a charity match organised to raise fund for Australian bushfire victims. [ 322 ]\nHe captained the India legends team to victory in the 2020–21 Road Safety World Series and was the leading run scorer for the Indian team in the tournament. [ 323 ] [ 324 ]\nHe acted as a coach for the Ponting XI during The Big Appeal . During the innings break, he batted an over against Ellyse Perry and Annabel Sutherland at Perry's request. [ 325 ] [ 326 ]\nTendulkar was made the Icon player and captain for his home side, the Mumbai Indians in the inaugural Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition in 2008. [ 327 ] As an icon player, he was signed for a sum of US$1,121,250, 15% more than the second-highest paid player in the team, Sanath Jayasuriya . [ 328 ]\nIn 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh 's record of most runs in an IPL season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony. [ 329 ] Tendulkar has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different seasons as a captain. [ 330 ]\nSachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of the second edition of the Champions League T20. He scored 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana. But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after losing the initial two matches. Tendulkar scored 135 runs. [ 331 ]\nIn the 2011 IPL, against Kochi Tuskers Kerala , Tendulkar scored his maiden Twenty20 hundred. He scored 100 not out off 66 balls. In 2013, Tendulkar retired from Indian Premier League and in 2014 he was appointed as the Mumbai Indian's \"Team Icon\". [ 332 ] [ 333 ] His last match for the team was the final of the 2013 Champions League , where he scored 14 runs in an Indians victory. In his 78 matches in the IPL, Tendulkar scored a total of 2,334 runs; at the time of his retirement he was the fifth-highest run-scorer in the competition's history. [ 334 ] Mumbai Indians retired his number 10 jersey as a tribute to Tendulkar. [ 335 ] He recently stepped down as the mentor of the franchise citing personal reasons. [ 336 ]\nTendulkar is cross-dominant : he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand. [ 337 ] [ 338 ] He would also practice left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. ESPNcricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the \"most wholesome batsman of his time\". [ 29 ] His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia. [ 29 ] He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive , often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot. [ 339 ] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar , in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that \"it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does\". [ 340 ]\nSir Donald Bradman , considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that, \"Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar\". [ 341 ] [ 342 ]\nFormer Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork. [ 343 ] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace. [ 343 ] He has been affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since then, Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career, and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell , former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that, \"Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke\". [ 344 ]\nTendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep , the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips ' heads, especially in his later years. He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently. [ 345 ]\nWhile Tendulkar was not a regular bowler, he could bowl medium pace , leg spin , and off spin . He often bowled when two batsmen of the opposite team had been batting together for a long period, as he could often be a useful partnership breaker. [ 346 ] With his bowling, he helped secure an Indian victory on more than one occasion. [ 347 ] He took 201 international wickets in his career—46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs, where he is India's twelfth-highest wicket taker , and one wicket in Twenty20 Internationals . [ 348 ]\nTendulkar is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential cricketers in the history of cricket . His consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including among Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries. [ 82 ] One of the most popular sayings by his fans is, \"Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God\". [ 349 ] ESPNcricinfo mentions in his profile that, \"... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world\". [ 29 ]\nDuring the Australian tour of India in 1998, Matthew Hayden said, \"I have seen God. He bats at no. 4 in India in Tests\". [ 350 ] However, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said, \"I am not God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn't\". [ 351 ] Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film Stumped in 2003, appearing as himself. [ 352 ] [ unreliable fringe source? ]\nOn 24 February 2010, the cricket website ESPNcricinfo could not handle the heavy traffic experienced after Tendulkar broke the record for the highest individual male score in a One Day International match against South Africa, also becoming the first player to score 200* in the history of ODIs as more than 5 million fans visited the website at a time. [ 353 ] [ 354 ]\nThere have been many instances when Tendulkar's fans undertook extreme activities over his dismissal in a game. As reported by many Indian newspapers, for example, a young man hanged himself due to distress over Tendulkar's failure to reach his 100th century. [ 355 ]\nAt home in Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to \"wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night\". [ 344 ] In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence. [ 356 ]\nIn the 2021 IPL , season he worked for Mumbai Indians team as a mentor. [ 357 ]\nTendulkar is the leading run-scorer in Test matches, with 15,921 runs, as well as in ODI matches, with 18,426 runs. [ 29 ] He is the only player to score more than 30,000 runs combined in all forms of international cricket (Test, ODI, and Twenty20). [ 24 ] He is the 16th player and the first Indian to score 50,000 runs in all forms of domestic and international recognised cricket (First-class, List A, and Twenty20). He achieved this feat on 5 October 2013, during a Champions League Twenty20 match for his IPL team Mumbai Indians against Trinidad and Tobago . [ 393 ] [ 394 ] [ 395 ]\nTendulkar has scored over 1,000 runs in a calendar year in ODIs 7 times, and in 1998 he scored 1,894 runs, the record for the highest number of runs scored by any player in a single calendar year for One-Day Internationals. [ 396 ] He is the first male cricketer to score a double-century in one-day cricket. [ 267 ]\nTendulkar was also one half of the most prolific Test cricket partnership to date, alongside Rahul Dravid .
