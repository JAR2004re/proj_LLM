      "lead": "Elon Reeve Musk ( / \u02c8 i\u02d0 l \u0252 n / EE -lon ; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman and entrepreneur known for his leadership of Tesla , SpaceX , Twitter , and xAI . Musk has been the wealthiest person in the world since 2025; as of February 2026, [update] Forbes estimates his net worth to be around US$852 billion.\nBorn into a wealthy family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated in 1989 to Canada; he has Canadian citizenship since his mother was born there. He received bachelor's degrees in 1997 from the University of Pennsylvania before moving to California to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2 . Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com , an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal , which was acquired by eBay in 2002. Musk also became an American citizen in 2002.\nIn 2002, Musk founded the space technology company SpaceX, becoming its CEO and chief engineer ; the company has since led innovations in reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight . Musk joined the automaker Tesla as an early investor in 2004 and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has since become a leader in electric vehicles . In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI to advance artificial intelligence (AI) research, but later left; growing discontent with the organization's direction and their leadership in the AI boom in the 2020s led him to establish xAI , which became a subsidiary of SpaceX in 2026. In 2022, he acquired the social network Twitter, implementing significant changes , and rebranding it as X in 2023. His other businesses include the neurotechnology company Neuralink , which he co-founded in 2016, and the tunneling company the Boring Company , which he founded in 2017. In November 2025, a Tesla pay package worth $1 trillion for Musk was approved, which he is to receive over 10 years if he meets specific goals.\nMusk was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S. presidential election , where he supported Donald Trump . After Trump was inaugurated as president in early 2025, Musk served as Senior Advisor to the President and as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). After a public feud with Trump , Musk left the Trump administration and returned to managing his companies. Musk is a supporter of global far-right figures, causes, and political parties. His political activities , views , and statements have made him a polarizing figure . Musk has been criticized for COVID-19 misinformation , promoting conspiracy theories , and affirming antisemitic , racist, and transphobic comments . His acquisition of Twitter was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service, following his pledge to decrease censorship . His role in the second Trump administration attracted public backlash , particularly in response to DOGE . The emails he sent to Jeffrey Epstein are included in the Epstein files , which were published between 2025\u201326 and became a topic of worldwide debate.\nElon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria , South Africa's administrative capital. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] His mother, Maye ( n\u00e9e Haldeman ), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan , Canada, and raised in South Africa. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Musk therefore holds both South African and Canadian citizenship from birth. [ 8 ] His father, Errol Musk , is a South African electromechanical engineer , pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at Timbavati Private Nature Reserve . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]\nHis maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman , who died in a plane crash when Elon was a toddler, was an American-born Canadian chiropractor , aviator and political activist in the technocracy movement [ 13 ] [ 14 ] who moved to South Africa in 1950. [ 15 ]\nElon has a younger brother, Kimbal , a younger sister, Tosca , and four paternal half-siblings. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 7 ] [ 18 ] Musk was baptized as a child in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa . [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine, [ 12 ] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines\". [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid . [ 1 ]\nAfter his parents divorced in 1979, Elon, aged around 9, chose to live with his father because Errol Musk had an Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica and a computer. [ 23 ] [ 3 ] [ 9 ] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father. [ 24 ] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school that he described as a \"paramilitary Lord of the Flies \" where \"bullying was a virtue\" and children were encouraged to fight over rations. [ 25 ] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries. [ 26 ] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital. [ 26 ] Errol denied berating Elon and claimed, \"The [other] boy had just lost his father to suicide, and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?\" [ 27 ]\nElon was an enthusiastic reader of books, and had attributed his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings , the Foundation series , and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy . [ 11 ] [ 28 ] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual. [ 29 ] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC -based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500 (equivalent to $1,600 in 2025). [ 30 ] [ 31 ]\nMusk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School , Bryanston High School , and then Pretoria Boys High School , where he graduated. [ 32 ] Musk was a decent but unexceptional student, earning a 61/100 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification. [ 33 ] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother to avoid South Africa's mandatory military service , [ 34 ] [ 35 ] which would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime, [ 1 ] as well as to ease his path to immigration to the United States. [ 36 ] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months. [ 37 ]\nMusk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan , [ 38 ] [ 39 ] and worked odd jobs, including at a farm and a lumber mill. [ 40 ] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario . [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania , where he studied until 1995. [ 43 ] Although Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 \u2013 a Bachelor of Arts in physics and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university's Wharton School . [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books . [ 49 ]\nIn 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley : one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic supercapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto \u2013based startup Rocket Science Games . [ 50 ] [ 51 ] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University , but did not enroll. [ 46 ] [ 44 ] [ 52 ] Musk decided to join the Internet boom of the 1990s, applying for a job at Netscape , to which he reportedly never received a response. [ 53 ] [ 34 ] The Washington Post reported that Musk lacked legal authorization to remain and work in the United States after failing to enroll at Stanford. [ 52 ] In response, Musk said he was allowed to work at that time and that his student visa transitioned to an H1-B . According to numerous former business associates and shareholders, Musk said he was on a student visa at the time. [ 54 ]\nIn 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal , and Greg Kouri founded the web software company Zip2 with funding from a group of angel investors. [ 55 ] They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto. [ 56 ] Replying to Rolling Stone , Musk denounced the notion that they started their company with funds borrowed from Errol Musk, [ 24 ] but in a tweet, he recognized that his father contributed 10% of a later funding round. [ 57 ] The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages. [ 58 ]\nAccording to Musk, \"The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time.\" [ 56 ] To impress investors, Musk built a large plastic structure around a standard computer to create the impression that Zip2 was powered by a small supercomputer. [ 59 ] The Musk brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune , [ 60 ] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch . [ 61 ] Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board. [ 62 ] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999 (equivalent to $590,000,000 in 2025), [ 63 ] [ 64 ] and Musk received $22 million (equivalent to $43,000,000 in 2025) for his 7-percent share. [ 65 ]\nIn 1999, Musk co-founded X.com , an online financial services and e-mail payment company. [ 66 ] The startup was one of the first federally insured online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers joined the service. [ 67 ] The company's investors regarded Musk as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year. [ 68 ] The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition. [ 56 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel , [ 70 ] Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal , which was more popular than X.com's service. [ 71 ]\nWithin the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference for Microsoft software over Unix created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign. [ 72 ] Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in 2000. [ 73 ] [ b ] Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion (equivalent to $2,700,000,000 in 2025) in stock, of which Musk\u2014the largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares\u2014received $175.8 million (equivalent to $320,000,000 in 2025). [ 77 ] [ 78 ] In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it had sentimental value. [ 79 ] [ 80 ]\nIn 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars . [ 81 ] Seeking a way to launch the greenhouse payloads into space, Musk made two unsuccessful trips to Moscow to purchase intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) from Russian companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras . Musk instead decided to start a company to build affordable rockets. [ 82 ] With $100 million of his early fortune, [ 83 ] (equivalent to $180,000,000 in 2025) Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer. [ 84 ] [ 85 ]\nSpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006. [ 86 ] Although the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit , it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA , then led by Mike Griffin . [ 87 ] [ 88 ] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk to go bankrupt, [ 86 ] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008. [ 89 ] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion NASA contract (equivalent to $2,400,000,000 in 2025) for Falcon 9 -launched Dragon spacecraft flights to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement . [ 90 ] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS , a first for a commercial spacecraft. [ 91 ]\nWorking towards its goal of reusable rockets , in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform. [ 92 ] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships , an ocean-based recovery platform. [ 93 ] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy ; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload . [ 94 ] [ 95 ] Since 2019, [ 96 ] SpaceX has been developing Starship , a reusable, super heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. [ 97 ] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2 , becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS. [ 98 ] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million (equivalent to $865,000,000 in 2025) contract to build a spacecraft that NASA will use to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan. [ 99 ]\nIn 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access . [ 100 ] After the launch of prototype satellites in 2018, the first large constellation was deployed in May 2019. [ 101 ] As of May 2025 [update] , over 7,600 Starlink satellites are operational, [ 102 ] comprising 65% of all operational Earth satellites. [ 103 ] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be $10 billion (equivalent to $12,000,000,000 in 2025). [ 104 ] [ c ]\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine , Musk provided free Starlink service to Ukraine , permitting Internet access and communication at a yearly cost to SpaceX of $400 million (equivalent to $440,000,000 in 2025). [ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] However, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] In 2023, Musk denied Ukraine's request to activate Starlink over Crimea to aid an attack against the Russian navy, citing fears of a nuclear response. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ]\nTesla, Inc. , originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning . Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. [ 117 ] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35 million (equivalent to $11,000,000 in 2025), became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman. [ 118 ] [ 119 ] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. [ 120 ] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis , Eberhard was ousted from the firm. [ 121 ] [ page needed ] [ 122 ] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008. [ 123 ] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others. [ 124 ] [ 125 ]\nTesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first mass production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells. [ 126 ] Under Musk, Tesla has since launched several well-selling electric vehicles, including the four-door sedan Model S (2012), the crossover Model X (2015), the mass-market sedan Model 3 (2017), the crossover Model Y (2020), and the pickup truck Cybertruck (2023). [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ] [ 131 ]\nIn May 2020, Musk resigned as chairman of the board as part of the settlement of a lawsuit from the SEC over him tweeting that funding had been \"secured\" for potentially taking Tesla private. [ 132 ] [ 133 ]\nThe company has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, called Gigafactories . [ 134 ] Since its initial public offering in 2010, [ 135 ] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020, [ 136 ] [ 137 ] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year. [ 138 ] [ 139 ] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion (equivalent to $1,200,000,000,000 in 2025), the sixth company in U.S. history to do so. [ 140 ]\nMusk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity , which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006. [ 141 ] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States. [ 142 ] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo , New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States. [ 143 ] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020. [ 144 ] [ 145 ]\nTesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in 2016 (equivalent to $2,700,000,000 in 2025) and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy . The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues. [ 146 ] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders. [ 147 ] [ 148 ] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant. [ 149 ] [ 150 ] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor. [ 146 ]\nIn 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink , a neurotechnology startup, with an investment of $100 million. [ 151 ] [ 152 ] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software. [ 152 ] [ 153 ] The company also hopes to develop devices to treat neurological conditions like spinal cord injuries . [ 154 ] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year. [ 155 ] In September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Neuralink to initiate six-year human trials. [ 156 ]\nNeuralink has conducted animal testing on macaques at the University of California, Davis . In 2021, the company released a video in which a macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials\u2014which have caused the deaths of some monkeys\u2014have led to claims of animal cruelty . The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink violated the Animal Welfare Act . [ 157 ] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink. [ 158 ] [ needs update ]\nIn 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels; he also revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities. [ 159 ] [ 160 ] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits. [ 161 ]\nThe Los Angeles tunnel , less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds. [ 162 ] Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled. [ 163 ] [ 164 ] A tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021. [ 165 ] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system. [ 166 ]\nIn early 2017, Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter and had questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech . [ 168 ] [ 169 ] [ 170 ] By 2022, Musk had reached 9.2% stake in the company, [ 171 ] making him the largest shareholder. [ 172 ] [ d ] Musk later agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company. [ 174 ] [ 175 ] Days later, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter. [ 172 ] [ 176 ] By the end of April Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion. [ 177 ] This included approximately $12.5 billion in loans and $21 billion in equity financing . [ 178 ] [ 179 ] Having backtracked on his initial decision, [ 180 ] Musk bought the company on October 27, 2022. [ 181 ]\nImmediately after the acquisition , Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal ; [ 181 ] [ 182 ] Musk became the CEO instead. [ 183 ] Under Elon Musk , Twitter instituted monthly subscriptions for a \" blue check \", [ 184 ] [ 185 ] [ 186 ] and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff. [ 187 ] [ 188 ] Musk lessened content moderation and hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover. [ 189 ] [ 190 ] [ 191 ] [ 192 ] In late 2022, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election . [ 193 ] Musk also promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll, [ 194 ] [ 195 ] and five months later, Musk stepped down as CEO and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer (CTO). [ 196 ]\nDespite Musk stepping down as CEO, X continues to struggle with challenges such as viral misinformation , [ 197 ] hate speech , and antisemitism controversies. [ 198 ] [ 199 ] Musk has been accused of trying to silence some of his critics such as Twitch streamer Asmongold , who criticized him during one of his streams. [ 200 ] Musk has been accused of removing their accounts' blue checkmarks , which hinders visibility and is considered a form of shadow banning , [ 201 ] [ 202 ] or suspending their accounts without justification. [ 203 ]\nIn August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vactrain , and assigned engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to design a transport system between Greater Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area , at an estimated cost of $6 billion. [ 204 ] [ 205 ] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, dubbed the Hyperloop , [ 206 ] intended to make travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances. [ 207 ]\nIn December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI , a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence , intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity. [ 208 ] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to the company, [ 209 ] and initially gave $50 million. [ 210 ] In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board. [ 211 ] Since 2018, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning. [ 212 ] In July 2023, Musk launched the artificial intelligence company xAI , which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like OpenAI's ChatGPT . Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla, [ 213 ] and xAI hired engineers from Google and OpenAI. [ 214 ]\nMusk uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020. [ 216 ] [ 217 ] His heavy use of the jets and the consequent fossil fuel usage have received criticism. [ 216 ] [ 218 ] Musk's flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet . [ 219 ] [ 220 ] [ 221 ] In December 2022, Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, and made temporary bans on the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O'Sullivan , Keith Olbermann , and journalists from The New York Times , The Washington Post , CNN, and The Intercept . [ 222 ]\nIn October 2025, Musk's company xAI launched Grokipedia, an AI-generated online encyclopedia that he promoted as an alternative to Wikipedia. [ 223 ] [ 224 ] Articles on Grokipedia are generated and reviewed by xAI's Grok chatbot. [ 225 ]\nMedia coverage and academic analysis described Grokipedia as frequently reusing Wikipedia content but framing contested political and social topics in line with Musk's own views and right-wing narratives. A study by Cornell University researchers and NBC News stated that Grokipedia cites sources that are blacklisted or considered \"generally unreliable\" on Wikipedia, for example, the conspiracy site Infowars and the neo-Nazi forum Stormfront . Wired , The Guardian and Time criticized Grokipedia for factual errors and for presenting Musk himself in unusually positive terms while downplaying controversies. [ 223 ] [ 226 ] [ 227 ] [ 228 ] [ 229 ]\nMusk is an outlier among business leaders who typically avoid partisan political advocacy. [ 230 ] [ 231 ] [ 232 ] Musk was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. [ 233 ] Historically, he has donated to both Democrats and Republicans , [ 234 ] many of whom serve in states in which he has a vested interest. [ 235 ] Since 2022, his political contributions have mostly supported Republicans, with his first vote for a Republican going to Mayra Flores in the 2022 Texas's 34th congressional district special election . [ 236 ] [ 237 ] In 2024, he started supporting international far-right political parties, activists, and causes, [ 238 ] and has shared misinformation [ 239 ] [ 240 ] [ 241 ] and numerous conspiracy theories . [ 242 ] [ 243 ] Since 2024, his views have been generally described as right-wing. [ 244 ]\nMusk supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 , [ 245 ] Hillary Clinton in 2016 , Joe Biden in 2020 , [ 246 ] and Donald Trump in 2024 . [ 247 ] In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries , Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for Yang's proposed universal basic income , [ 248 ] and endorsed Kanye West 's 2020 presidential campaign . [ 249 ] In 2021, Musk publicly expressed opposition to the Build Back Better Act , a $3.5 trillion legislative package endorsed by Joe Biden that ultimately failed to pass due to unanimous opposition from congressional Republicans and several Democrats. [ 250 ]\nIn 2022, gave over $50 million to Citizens for Sanity , a conservative political action committee . [ 251 ] In 2023, he supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 U.S. presidential election , giving $10 million to his campaign, [ 251 ] and hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event. [ 252 ] [ 253 ] [ 254 ] From June 2023 to January 2024, Musk hosted a bipartisan set of X Spaces with Republican and Democratic candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , [ 255 ] Vivek Ramaswamy , [ 256 ] and Dean Phillips . [ 257 ]\nIn October 2025, former vice-president Kamala Harris commented that it was a mistake from the Democratic side to not invite Musk to a White House electric vehicle event organized in August 2021 and featuring executives from General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, despite Tesla being \"the major American manufacturer of extraordinary innovation in this space.\" Fortune remarked that this was a nod to United Auto Workers and organized labor. Harris said presidents should put aside political loyalties when it came to recognizing innovation, and guessed that the non-invitation impacted Musk's perspective. Fortune noted that, at the time, Musk said, \"Yeah, seems odd that Tesla wasn't invited.\" A month later, he criticized Biden as \"not the friendliest administration.\" [ 258 ] Jacob Silverman, author of the book Gilded Rage: Elon Musk and the Radicalization of Silicon Valley , said that the tech industry represented by Musk, Thiel, Andreessen and other capitalists, actually flourished under Biden, but the tech leaders chose Trump for their common ground on cultural issues. [ 259 ]\nBy early 2024, Musk had become a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump. [ 260 ] In July 2024, minutes after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump , Musk endorsed him for president saying; \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\" [ 261 ] [ 262 ] During the presidential campaign , Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally, [ 263 ] and during the campaign promoted conspiracy theories and falsehoods about Democrats, election fraud [ 264 ] and immigration, in support of Trump. [ 265 ] [ 266 ] Musk was the largest individual donor of the 2024 election. [ 267 ] In 2025, Musk contributed $19 million to the Wisconsin Supreme Court race , hoping to influence the state's future redistricting efforts and its regulations governing car manufacturers and dealers. [ 268 ] [ 269 ]\nIn 2023, Musk said he shunned the World Economic Forum because it was boring. The organization commented that they had not invited him since 2015. [ 270 ] He has participated in Dialog , dubbed \"Tech Bilderberg \" and organized by Peter Thiel and Auren Hoffman , though. [ 271 ] [ 272 ]\nMusk's international political actions and comments have come under increasing scrutiny and criticism, especially from the governments and leaders of France, Germany, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom, particularly due to his position in the U.S. government as well as ownership of X. [ 273 ] [ 274 ] [ 275 ] An NBC News analysis found he had boosted far-right political movements to cut immigration and curtail regulation of business in at least 18 countries on six continents since 2023. [ 276 ]\nDuring his speech after the second inauguration of Donald Trump , Musk twice made a gesture interpreted by many as a Nazi or a fascist Roman salute . [ e ] He thumped his right hand over his heart, fingers spread wide, and then extended his right arm out, emphatically, at an upward angle, palm down and fingers together. He then repeated the gesture to the crowd behind him. As he finished the gestures, he said to the crowd, \"My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured.\" [ 277 ] [ 278 ]\nIt was widely condemned as an intentional Nazi salute in Germany, [ 280 ] [ 281 ] where making such gestures is illegal . [ 282 ] The Anti-Defamation League said it was not a Nazi salute, [ 283 ] but other Jewish organizations disagreed and condemned the salute. [ 284 ] [ 285 ] American public opinion was divided on partisan lines as to whether it was a fascist salute. [ 286 ] Musk dismissed the accusations of Nazi sympathies, deriding them as \"dirty tricks\" and a \"tired\" attack. [ 287 ] [ 288 ] Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups celebrated it as a Nazi salute. [ 283 ] [ 289 ] Multiple European political parties demanded that Musk be banned from entering their countries. [ 290 ] [ 291 ]\nThe concept of DOGE emerged in a discussion between Musk and Donald Trump , and in August 2024, Trump committed to giving Musk an advisory role, with Musk accepting the offer. [ 292 ] In November and December 2024, Musk suggested that the organization could help to cut the U.S. federal budget , consolidate the number of federal agencies, [ 293 ] [ 294 ] and eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , [ 295 ] [ 296 ] and that its final stage would be \"deleting itself\". [ 297 ]\nIn January 2025, the organization was created by executive order , and Musk was designated a \" special government employee \". [ 298 ] [ 299 ] Musk led the organization and was a senior advisor to the president , [ 300 ] although his official role is not clear. [ 301 ] In sworn statement during a lawsuit, the director of the White House Office of Administration stated that Musk \"is not an employee of the U.S. DOGE Service or U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization\", \"is not the U.S. DOGE Service administrator\", and has \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself\". [ 302 ] [ 303 ] Trump said two days later that he had put Musk in charge of DOGE. [ 304 ] A federal judge has ruled that Musk acted as the de facto leader of DOGE. [ 305 ]\nMusk's role in the second Trump administration , particularly in response to DOGE , has attracted public backlash . He was criticized for his treatment of federal government employees, [ 306 ] [ 307 ] [ 308 ] including his influence over the mass layoffs of the federal workforce . [ 309 ] [ 310 ] [ 311 ] He has prioritized secrecy within the organization [ 312 ] and has accused others of violating privacy laws. [ 298 ] A Senate report alleged that Musk could avoid up to $2 billion in legal liability as a result of DOGE's actions. [ 313 ] In May 2025, Bill Gates accused Musk of \"killing the world's poorest children\" through his cuts to USAID , [ 314 ] which modeling by Boston University estimated had resulted in 300,000 deaths by this time, most of them of children. [ 315 ] [ 316 ] By November 2025, the estimated death toll had increased to 400,000 children and 200,000 adults. [ 317 ]\nMusk announced on May 28, 2025, that he would depart from the Trump administration as planned when the special government employee's 130 day deadline expired, [ 318 ] with a White House official confirming that Musk's offboarding from the Trump administration was already underway. [ 319 ] His departure was officially confirmed during a joint Oval Office press conference with Trump on May 30, 2025. [ 320 ]\nAfter leaving office, Musk criticized the Trump administration's Big Beautiful Bill , calling it a \"disgusting abomination\" due to its provisions increasing the deficit. [ 322 ] A feud began between Musk and Trump, with its most notable event being Musk alleging Trump had ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on X (formerly Twitter) on June 5, 2025. [ 323 ] [ 324 ] Trump responded on Truth Social stating that Musk went \"CRAZY\" after the \"EV Mandate\" was purportedly taken away and threatened to cut Musk's government contracts. [ 325 ] [ 326 ] Musk then called for a third Trump impeachment. [ 327 ] The next day, Trump stated that he did not wish to reconcile with Musk, and added that Musk would face \"very serious consequences\" if he funds Democratic candidates. [ 328 ] On June 11, Musk publicly apologized for the tweets against Trump, saying they \"went too far\". [ 329 ]\nRejecting the conservative label, [ 331 ] Musk has described himself as a political moderate , even as his views have become more right-wing over time. [ 332 ] His views have been characterized as libertarian and far-right , [ 333 ] [ 334 ] and after his involvement in European politics , they have received criticism from world leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz . [ 335 ] [ 336 ] [ 337 ] [ 338 ]\nWithin the context of American politics , Musk supported Democratic candidates up until 2022, at which point he voted for a Republican for the first time. [ 245 ] [ 247 ] He has stated support for universal basic income , [ 339 ] gun rights , [ 340 ] freedom of speech , [ 341 ] a tax on carbon emissions , [ 342 ] and H-1B visas . [ 343 ] Musk has expressed concern about issues such as artificial intelligence (AI) [ 344 ] and climate change , [ 345 ] and has been a critic of wealth tax , [ 346 ] short-selling , [ 347 ] and government subsidies . [ 348 ] An immigrant himself, Musk has been accused of being anti-immigration , and regularly blames immigration policies for illegal immigration . [ 349 ] He is also a pronatalist who believes population decline is the biggest threat to civilization, [ 350 ] and identifies as a cultural Christian . [ 351 ] [ 352 ] Musk has long been an advocate for space colonization , especially the colonization of Mars . He has repeatedly pushed for humanity colonizing Mars, in order to become an interplanetary species and lower the risks of human extinction . [ 353 ]\nMusk has promoted conspiracy theories and made controversial statements that have led to accusations of racism , sexism , antisemitism , [ 354 ] [ 355 ] transphobia , [ 356 ] disseminating disinformation , and support of white pride . [ 357 ] [ 358 ] While describing himself as a \"pro-Semite\", [ 359 ] his comments regarding George Soros and Jewish communities have been condemned by the Anti-Defamation League and the Biden White House . [ 360 ] Musk was criticized during the COVID-19 pandemic for making unfounded epidemiological claims, [ 361 ] defying COVID-19 lockdowns restrictions, [ 362 ] and supporting the Canada convoy protest against vaccine mandates . [ 363 ] [ 364 ] He has amplified false claims of white genocide in South Africa. [ 365 ]\nMusk has been critical of Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip during the Gaza war , [ 366 ] praised China's economic and climate goals, [ 367 ] [ 368 ] suggested that Taiwan and China should resolve cross-strait relations , [ 369 ] [ 370 ] and was described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government . [ 367 ] [ 368 ]\nIn Europe, Musk expressed support for Ukraine in 2022 during the Russian invasion , recommended referendums and peace deals on the annexed Russia-occupied territories , [ 371 ] [ 372 ] and supported the far-right Alternative for Germany political party in 2024. [ 373 ] Regarding British politics , Musk blamed the 2024 UK riots on mass migration and open borders , [ 374 ] [ 375 ] criticized Prime Minister Keir Starmer for what he described as a \"two-tier\" policing system, [ 376 ] [ 377 ] [ 375 ] and was subsequently attacked as being responsible for spreading misinformation and amplifying the far-right. [ 378 ] He has also voiced his support for far-right activist Tommy Robinson and pledged electoral support for Reform UK . [ 379 ] [ 380 ]\nIn February 2026, Musk described Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez as a \"tyrant\" following S\u00e1nchez's proposal to prohibit minors under the age of 16 from accessing social media platforms. [ 381 ]\nIn 2018, Musk was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a tweet stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private. [ 132 ] [ f ] The securities fraud lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies . [ 132 ] [ 385 ] [ 386 ] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO. [ 133 ] Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet, [ 387 ] and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable. [ 388 ] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation. [ 389 ] [ 390 ]\nIn 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year. [ 391 ] The SEC reacted by asking a court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement details, [ 392 ] including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance. [ 393 ] In 2020, a judge blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo \") violated the agreement. [ 394 ] [ 395 ] Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-released records showed that the SEC concluded Musk had subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding \" Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price\". [ 396 ]\nIn October 2023, the SEC sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022. [ 397 ] [ 398 ] [ 399 ] In February 2024, Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again. [ 400 ] In January 2025, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Musk for securities violations related to his purchase of Twitter. [ 401 ] In January 2024, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk's $55 billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded. [ 402 ] McCormick called the compensation granted by the company's board \"an unfathomable sum\" that was unfair to shareholders. [ 403 ] The Delaware Supreme Court overturned McCormick's decision in December 2025, restoring Musk's compensation package and awarding $1 in nominal damages . [ 404 ]\nMusk became a U.S. citizen in 2002. [ 43 ] From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded. [ 405 ] He then relocated to Cameron County, Texas , [ 406 ] [ 407 ] saying that California had become \"complacent\" about its economic success. [ 405 ] [ 408 ] [ 409 ]\nWhile hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome (an outdated term for autism spectrum disorder ). [ 410 ] [ 411 ] When asked about his experience growing up with Asperger's syndrome in a TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Musk stated that \"the social cues were not intuitive ... I would just tend to take things very literally ... but then that turned out to be wrong \u2014 [people were not] simply saying exactly what they mean, there's all sorts of other things that are meant, and [it] took me a while to figure that out.\" [ 412 ] Musk suffers from back pain and has undergone several spine-related surgeries, including a disc replacement. [ 413 ] [ 414 ] In 2000, he contracted a severe case of malaria while on vacation in South Africa. [ 415 ]\nMusk has stated he uses doctor-prescribed ketamine for occasional depression and that he doses \"a small amount once every other week or something like that\"; [ 416 ] since January 2024, some media outlets have reported that he takes ketamine , marijuana , LSD , ecstasy , mushrooms , cocaine and other drugs. Musk at first refused to comment on his alleged drug use, before responding that he had not tested positive for drugs, and that if drugs somehow improved his productivity, \"I would definitely take them!\". [ 417 ] The New York Times' investigations revealed Musk's overuse of ketamine and numerous other drugs, as well as strained family relationships and concerns from close associates who have become troubled by his public behavior as he became more involved in political activities and government work. [ 418 ] According to The Washington Post , President Trump described Musk as \"a big-time drug addict\". [ 419 ]\nThrough his own label Emo G Records, Musk released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe \", on SoundCloud in March 2019. [ 420 ] [ 421 ] [ 422 ] The following year, he released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals. [ 423 ]\nMusk plays video games, which he stated has a \"'restoring effect' that helps his 'mental calibration'\". [ 424 ] Some games he plays include Quake , Diablo IV , Elden Ring , and Polytopia . [ 425 ] [ 426 ] Musk once claimed to be one of the world's top video game players but has since admitted to \" account boosting \", or cheating by hiring outside services to achieve top player rankings. [ 427 ] [ 428 ] [ 429 ] Musk has justified the boosting by claiming that all top accounts do it so he has to as well to remain competitive. [ 430 ] [ 429 ] [ 431 ] In 2024 and 2025, Musk criticized the video game Assassin's Creed Shadows and its creator Ubisoft for \"woke\" content. [ 432 ] Musk posted to X that \"DEI kills art\" and specified the inclusion of the historical figure Yasuke in the Assassin's Creed game as offensive; he also called the game \"terrible\". Ubisoft responded by saying that Musk's comments were \"just feeding hatred\" and that they were focused on producing a game not pushing politics. [ 433 ] [ 434 ]\nMusk has fathered at least 14 children, one of whom died as an infant. [ 435 ] The Wall Street Journal reported in 2025 that sources close to Musk suggest that the \"true number of Musk's children is much higher than publicly known\". [ 436 ] He had six children with his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson , whom he met while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000. [ 437 ] In 2002, their first child Nevada Musk died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks. [ 438 ] After his death, the couple used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to continue their family; [ 439 ] they had twins in 2004, followed by triplets in 2006. [ 439 ] The couple divorced in 2008 and have shared custody of their children. [ 440 ] [ 441 ] The elder twin he had with Wilson came out as a trans woman and, in 2022, officially changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson , [ 442 ] adopting her mother's surname because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk. [ 442 ]\nMusk began dating English actress Talulah Riley in 2008. [ 443 ] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland. [ 444 ] [ 445 ] In 2012, the couple divorced, then remarried the following year. [ 446 ] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014, [ 446 ] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016. [ 447 ] Musk then dated the American actress Amber Heard for several months in 2017; [ 448 ] he had reportedly been \"pursuing\" her since 2012. [ 449 ]\nIn 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes confirmed they were dating. [ 450 ] Grimes and Musk have three children, born in 2020, 2021, and 2022. [ g ] Musk and Grimes originally gave their eldest child the name \"X \u00c6 A-12\", which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet; [ 455 ] [ 456 ] the names registered on the birth certificate are \"X\" as a first name, \"\u00c6 A- Xii \" as a middle name, and \"Musk\" as a last name. [ 457 ] [ 458 ] They received criticism for choosing a name perceived to be impractical and difficult to pronounce; [ 459 ] Musk has said the intended pronunciation is \"X Ash A Twelve\". [ 458 ] Their second child was born via surrogacy . [ 460 ] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single. [ 461 ] [ 462 ] In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of X \u00c6 A-Xii. [ 463 ] [ 464 ] [ 465 ] Elon Musk has taken X \u00c6 A-Xii to multiple official events in Washington, D.C. during Trump's second term in office . [ 466 ]\nAlso in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan , the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin , in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year. [ 467 ] Musk denied the report. [ 468 ] Musk also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett , who has been described as \"an occasional girlfriend\". [ 469 ] In October 2024, The New York Times reported Musk bought a Texas compound for his children and their mothers, [ 470 ] though Musk denied having done so. [ 471 ]\nMusk also has four children with Shivon Zilis , director of operations and special projects at Neuralink : twins born via IVF in 2021, a child born in 2024 via surrogacy and a child born in 2025. [ h ]\nOn February 14, 2025, Ashley St. Clair , an influencer and author, posted on X claiming to have given birth to Musk's son Romulus five months earlier, which media outlets reported as Musk's supposed thirteenth child. [ i ] On February 22, 2025, it was reported that St Clair had filed for sole custody of her five-month-old son and for Musk to be recognised as the child's father. [ 481 ] [ 482 ] On March 31, 2025, Musk wrote that, while he was unsure if he was the father of St. Clair's child, he had paid St. Clair $2.5 million and would continue paying her $500,000 per year. [ j ] Later reporting from the Wall Street Journal indicated that $1 million of these payments to St. Clair were structured as a loan. [ 436 ]\nIn 2014, Musk and Ghislaine Maxwell appeared together in a photograph taken at an Academy Awards after-party, which Musk later described as a \" photobomb \". [ 488 ] [ 489 ] The January 2026 Epstein files contain emails between Musk and Epstein from 2012 to 2013, after Epstein's first conviction .\nEmails released on January 30, 2026, indicated that Epstein invited Musk to visit his private island on multiple occasions. [ 490 ] The correspondence showed that while Epstein repeatedly encouraged Musk to attend, Musk did not visit the island. In one instance, Musk discussed the possibility of attending a party with his then-wife Talilah Riley and asked which day would be the \"wildest party\"; according to the emails, the visit did not take place after Epstein later cancelled the plans. [ k ]\nOn Christmas day in 2012, Musk emailed Epstein asking \"Do you have any parties planned? I\u2019ve been working to the edge of sanity this year and so, once my kids head home after Christmas, I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose. The invitation is much appreciated, but a peaceful island experience is the opposite of what I\u2019m looking for\". [ 496 ] Epstein replied that the \"ratio on my island\" might make Musk's wife uncomfortable to which Musk responded, \"Ratio is not a problem for Talulah\". [ 496 ]\nOn September 11, 2013, Epstein sent an email asking Musk if he had any plans for coming to New York for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly where many \"interesting people\" would be coming to his house to which Musk responded that \"Flying to NY to see UN diplomats do nothing would be an unwise use of time\". [ 497 ] Epstein responded by stating \"Do you think i am retarded. Just kidding, there is no one over 25 and all very cute.\" [ 497 ]\nMusk has denied any close relationship with Epstein and described him as a \"creep\" who attempted to ingratiate himself with influential people. [ 489 ] When Musk was asked in 2019 if he introduced Epstein to Mark Zuckerberg , Musk responded: \"I don\u2019t recall introducing Epstein to anyone, as I don\u2019t know the guy well enough to do so.\" [ 497 ] The released emails nonetheless showed cordial exchanges on a range of topics, including Musk's inquiry about parties on the island. [ 494 ] [ 498 ] [ 489 ] The correspondence also indicated that Musk suggested hosting Epstein at SpaceX, while Epstein separately discussed plans to tour SpaceX and bring \"the girls\", though there is no evidence that such a visit occurred. [ 499 ] Musk has described the release of the files a \"distraction\", later accusing the second Trump administration of suppressing them to protect powerful individuals, including Trump himself. [ l ]\nAlthough his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries starting in the 2000s, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions, while also often making controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Musk's actions and his expressed views have made him a polarizing figure. [ 515 ] Biographer Ashlee Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his \"part philosopher, part troll \" persona on Twitter. [ 516 ] He has drawn denouncement for using his platform to mock the self-selection of personal pronouns , [ 517 ] while also receiving praise for bringing international attention to matters like British survivors of grooming gangs . [ 518 ]\nMusk has been described as an American oligarch due to his extensive influence over public discourse, social media, industry, politics, and government policy. [ 519 ] After Trump's re-election, Musk's influence and actions during the transition period and the second presidency of Donald Trump led some to call him \"President Musk\", the \"actual president-elect\", \"shadow president\" or \"co-president\". [ 520 ] [ 521 ]\nAwards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008, [ 523 ] the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010, [ 524 ] and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012. [ 525 ] In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University [ 526 ] and an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Honorary Membership . [ 527 ] Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018. [ 528 ] [ m ] In 2022, Musk was elected to the National Academy of Engineering . [ 530 ]\nTime has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world in 2010, [ 531 ] 2013, [ 532 ] 2018, [ 533 ] and 2021. [ 534 ] Musk was selected as Time ' s \" Person of the Year \" for 2021. Then Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that, \"Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too.\" [ 535 ] [ 536 ]",
      "education": "Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria , South Africa's administrative capital. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] His mother, Maye ( n\u00e9e Haldeman ), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan , Canada, and raised in South Africa. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Musk therefore holds both South African and Canadian citizenship from birth. [ 8 ] His father, Errol Musk , is a South African electromechanical engineer , pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at Timbavati Private Nature Reserve . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]\nHis maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman , who died in a plane crash when Elon was a toddler, was an American-born Canadian chiropractor , aviator and political activist in the technocracy movement [ 13 ] [ 14 ] who moved to South Africa in 1950. [ 15 ]\nElon has a younger brother, Kimbal , a younger sister, Tosca , and four paternal half-siblings. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 7 ] [ 18 ] Musk was baptized as a child in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa . [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine, [ 12 ] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines\". [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid . [ 1 ]\nAfter his parents divorced in 1979, Elon, aged around 9, chose to live with his father because Errol Musk had an Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica and a computer. [ 23 ] [ 3 ] [ 9 ] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father. [ 24 ] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school that he described as a \"paramilitary Lord of the Flies \" where \"bullying was a virtue\" and children were encouraged to fight over rations. [ 25 ] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries. [ 26 ] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital. [ 26 ] Errol denied berating Elon and claimed, \"The [other] boy had just lost his father to suicide, and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?\" [ 27 ]\nElon was an enthusiastic reader of books, and had attributed his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings , the Foundation series , and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy . [ 11 ] [ 28 ] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual. [ 29 ] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC -based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500 (equivalent to $1,600 in 2025). [ 30 ] [ 31 ]\nMusk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School , Bryanston High School , and then Pretoria Boys High School , where he graduated. [ 32 ] Musk was a decent but unexceptional student, earning a 61/100 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification. [ 33 ] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother to avoid South Africa's mandatory military service , [ 34 ] [ 35 ] which would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime, [ 1 ] as well as to ease his path to immigration to the United States. [ 36 ] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months. [ 37 ]\nMusk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan , [ 38 ] [ 39 ] and worked odd jobs, including at a farm and a lumber mill. [ 40 ] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario . [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania , where he studied until 1995. [ 43 ] Although Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 \u2013 a Bachelor of Arts in physics and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university's Wharton School . [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books . [ 49 ]\nIn 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley : one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic supercapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto \u2013based startup Rocket Science Games . [ 50 ] [ 51 ] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University , but did not enroll. [ 46 ] [ 44 ] [ 52 ] Musk decided to join the Internet boom of the 1990s, applying for a job at Netscape , to which he reportedly never received a response. [ 53 ] [ 34 ] The Washington Post reported that Musk lacked legal authorization to remain and work in the United States after failing to enroll at Stanford. [ 52 ] In response, Musk said he was allowed to work at that time and that his student visa transitioned to an H1-B . According to numerous former business associates and shareholders, Musk said he was on a student visa at the time. [ 54 ]",

      "personal_life": "Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002. [ 43 ] From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded. [ 405 ] He then relocated to Cameron County, Texas , [ 406 ] [ 407 ] saying that California had become \"complacent\" about its economic success. [ 405 ] [ 408 ] [ 409 ]\nWhile hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome (an outdated term for autism spectrum disorder ). [ 410 ] [ 411 ] When asked about his experience growing up with Asperger's syndrome in a TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Musk stated that \"the social cues were not intuitive ... I would just tend to take things very literally ... but then that turned out to be wrong \u2014 [people were not] simply saying exactly what they mean, there's all sorts of other things that are meant, and [it] took me a while to figure that out.\" [ 412 ] Musk suffers from back pain and has undergone several spine-related surgeries, including a disc replacement. [ 413 ] [ 414 ] In 2000, he contracted a severe case of malaria while on vacation in South Africa. [ 415 ]\nMusk has stated he uses doctor-prescribed ketamine for occasional depression and that he doses \"a small amount once every other week or something like that\"; [ 416 ] since January 2024, some media outlets have reported that he takes ketamine , marijuana , LSD , ecstasy , mushrooms , cocaine and other drugs. Musk at first refused to comment on his alleged drug use, before responding that he had not tested positive for drugs, and that if drugs somehow improved his productivity, \"I would definitely take them!\". [ 417 ] The New York Times' investigations revealed Musk's overuse of ketamine and numerous other drugs, as well as strained family relationships and concerns from close associates who have become troubled by his public behavior as he became more involved in political activities and government work. [ 418 ] According to The Washington Post , President Trump described Musk as \"a big-time drug addict\". [ 419 ]\nThrough his own label Emo G Records, Musk released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe \", on SoundCloud in March 2019. [ 420 ] [ 421 ] [ 422 ] The following year, he released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals. [ 423 ]\nMusk plays video games, which he stated has a \"'restoring effect' that helps his 'mental calibration'\". [ 424 ] Some games he plays include Quake , Diablo IV , Elden Ring , and Polytopia . [ 425 ] [ 426 ] Musk once claimed to be one of the world's top video game players but has since admitted to \" account boosting \", or cheating by hiring outside services to achieve top player rankings. [ 427 ] [ 428 ] [ 429 ] Musk has justified the boosting by claiming that all top accounts do it so he has to as well to remain competitive. [ 430 ] [ 429 ] [ 431 ] In 2024 and 2025, Musk criticized the video game Assassin's Creed Shadows and its creator Ubisoft for \"woke\" content. [ 432 ] Musk posted to X that \"DEI kills art\" and specified the inclusion of the historical figure Yasuke in the Assassin's Creed game as offensive; he also called the game \"terrible\". Ubisoft responded by saying that Musk's comments were \"just feeding hatred\" and that they were focused on producing a game not pushing politics. [ 433 ] [ 434 ]\nMusk has fathered at least 14 children, one of whom died as an infant. [ 435 ] The Wall Street Journal reported in 2025 that sources close to Musk suggest that the \"true number of Musk's children is much higher than publicly known\". [ 436 ] He had six children with his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson , whom he met while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000. [ 437 ] In 2002, their first child Nevada Musk died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks. [ 438 ] After his death, the couple used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to continue their family; [ 439 ] they had twins in 2004, followed by triplets in 2006. [ 439 ] The couple divorced in 2008 and have shared custody of their children. [ 440 ] [ 441 ] The elder twin he had with Wilson came out as a trans woman and, in 2022, officially changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson , [ 442 ] adopting her mother's surname because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk. [ 442 ]\nMusk began dating English actress Talulah Riley in 2008. [ 443 ] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland. [ 444 ] [ 445 ] In 2012, the couple divorced, then remarried the following year. [ 446 ] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014, [ 446 ] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016. [ 447 ] Musk then dated the American actress Amber Heard for several months in 2017; [ 448 ] he had reportedly been \"pursuing\" her since 2012. [ 449 ]\nIn 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes confirmed they were dating. [ 450 ] Grimes and Musk have three children, born in 2020, 2021, and 2022. [ g ] Musk and Grimes originally gave their eldest child the name \"X \u00c6 A-12\", which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet; [ 455 ] [ 456 ] the names registered on the birth certificate are \"X\" as a first name, \"\u00c6 A- Xii \" as a middle name, and \"Musk\" as a last name. [ 457 ] [ 458 ] They received criticism for choosing a name perceived to be impractical and difficult to pronounce; [ 459 ] Musk has said the intended pronunciation is \"X Ash A Twelve\". [ 458 ] Their second child was born via surrogacy . [ 460 ] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single. [ 461 ] [ 462 ] In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of X \u00c6 A-Xii. [ 463 ] [ 464 ] [ 465 ] Elon Musk has taken X \u00c6 A-Xii to multiple official events in Washington, D.C. during Trump's second term in office . [ 466 ]\nAlso in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan , the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin , in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year. [ 467 ] Musk denied the report. [ 468 ] Musk also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett , who has been described as \"an occasional girlfriend\". [ 469 ] In October 2024, The New York Times reported Musk bought a Texas compound for his children and their mothers, [ 470 ] though Musk denied having done so. [ 471 ]\nMusk also has four children with Shivon Zilis , director of operations and special projects at Neuralink : twins born via IVF in 2021, a child born in 2024 via surrogacy and a child born in 2025. [ h ]\nOn February 14, 2025, Ashley St. Clair , an influencer and author, posted on X claiming to have given birth to Musk's son Romulus five months earlier, which media outlets reported as Musk's supposed thirteenth child. [ i ] On February 22, 2025, it was reported that St Clair had filed for sole custody of her five-month-old son and for Musk to be recognised as the child's father. [ 481 ] [ 482 ] On March 31, 2025, Musk wrote that, while he was unsure if he was the father of St. Clair's child, he had paid St. Clair $2.5 million and would continue paying her $500,000 per year. [ j ] Later reporting from the Wall Street Journal indicated that $1 million of these payments to St. Clair were structured as a loan. [ 436 ]\nIn 2014, Musk and Ghislaine Maxwell appeared together in a photograph taken at an Academy Awards after-party, which Musk later described as a \" photobomb \". [ 488 ] [ 489 ] The January 2026 Epstein files contain emails between Musk and Epstein from 2012 to 2013, after Epstein's first conviction .\nEmails released on January 30, 2026, indicated that Epstein invited Musk to visit his private island on multiple occasions. [ 490 ] The correspondence showed that while Epstein repeatedly encouraged Musk to attend, Musk did not visit the island. In one instance, Musk discussed the possibility of attending a party with his then-wife Talilah Riley and asked which day would be the \"wildest party\"; according to the emails, the visit did not take place after Epstein later cancelled the plans. [ k ]\nOn Christmas day in 2012, Musk emailed Epstein asking \"Do you have any parties planned? I\u2019ve been working to the edge of sanity this year and so, once my kids head home after Christmas, I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose. The invitation is much appreciated, but a peaceful island experience is the opposite of what I\u2019m looking for\". [ 496 ] Epstein replied that the \"ratio on my island\" might make Musk's wife uncomfortable to which Musk responded, \"Ratio is not a problem for Talulah\". [ 496 ]\nOn September 11, 2013, Epstein sent an email asking Musk if he had any plans for coming to New York for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly where many \"interesting people\" would be coming to his house to which Musk responded that \"Flying to NY to see UN diplomats do nothing would be an unwise use of time\". [ 497 ] Epstein responded by stating \"Do you think i am retarded. Just kidding, there is no one over 25 and all very cute.\" [ 497 ]\nMusk has denied any close relationship with Epstein and described him as a \"creep\" who attempted to ingratiate himself with influential people. [ 489 ] When Musk was asked in 2019 if he introduced Epstein to Mark Zuckerberg , Musk responded: \"I don\u2019t recall introducing Epstein to anyone, as I don\u2019t know the guy well enough to do so.\" [ 497 ] The released emails nonetheless showed cordial exchanges on a range of topics, including Musk's inquiry about parties on the island. [ 494 ] [ 498 ] [ 489 ] The correspondence also indicated that Musk suggested hosting Epstein at SpaceX, while Epstein separately discussed plans to tour SpaceX and bring \"the girls\", though there is no evidence that such a visit occurred. [ 499 ] Musk has described the release of the files a \"distraction\", later accusing the second Trump administration of suppressing them to protect powerful individuals, including Trump himself.

      "lead": "Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace ( n\u00e9e Byron ; 10 December 1815 \u2013 27 November 1852), also known as Ada Lovelace , was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for work on Charles Babbage 's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer , the analytical engine . She was the first to recognise the machine had applications beyond pure calculation. Lovelace is often considered the first computer programmer.\nLovelace was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and reformer Anne Isabella Milbanke . [ 2 ] Lord Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born, and died when she was eight. Although often ill in childhood, Lovelace pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was a Baron, and was created Viscount Ockham and 1st Earl of Lovelace in 1838. The name Lovelace was chosen because Ada was descended from the extinct Baron Lovelaces . [ 3 ] The title given to her husband thus made Ada the Countess of Lovelace.\nLovelace's educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse , Charles Babbage , David Brewster , Charles Wheatstone and Michael Faraday , and the author Charles Dickens , contacts which she used to further her education. Lovelace described her approach as \"poetical science\" [ 4 ] and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician )\". [ 5 ] When she was eighteen, Lovelace's mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage. She was particularly interested in Babbage's work on the analytical engine . Lovelace first met him on 5 June 1833, when she and her mother attended one of Charles Babbage's Saturday night soir\u00e9es [ 6 ] with their mutual friend, and Lovelace's private tutor, Mary Somerville .\nThough Babbage's Analytical Engine was never constructed and did not influence the invention of electronic computers, it has been recognised as a Turing-complete general-purpose computer, which anticipated the essential features of a modern electronic computer. Babbage is therefore known as the \"father of computers,\" and Lovelace is credited with several computing \"firsts\" for her collaboration with him. Lovelace translated an article by the military engineer Luigi Menabrea about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with seven long explanatory notes . These described a method of using the machine to calculate Bernoulli numbers which is often called the first published computer program . She developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage, focused only on those capabilities. [ 7 ] Lovelace was the first to point out the possibility of encoding information besides mere arithmetical figures, such as music, and manipulating it with such a machine. Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the analytical engine, examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool. [ 8 ] Ada is widely commemorated, including in the names of a programming language, roads, buildings and institutes, as well as programmes, lectures and courses. There are plaques, statues, paintings, literary and non-fiction works.\nLord Byron expected his child to be a \"glorious boy\" and was disappointed when Lady Byron gave birth to a girl. [ 9 ] The child was named after Byron's half-sister, Augusta Leigh , and was called \"Ada\" by Byron himself. [ 10 ] On 16 January 1816, at Lord Byron's command, Lady Byron left for her parents' home at Kirkby Mallory , taking their five-week-old daughter with her. [ 9 ] Although English law at the time granted full custody of children to the father in cases of separation, Lord Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights, [ 11 ] but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada's welfare. [ 12 ]\nOn 21 April, Lord Byron signed the deed of separation , although very reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later. [ 13 ] Aside from an acrimonious separation, Lady Byron continued throughout her life to make allegations about her husband's immoral behaviour. [ 14 ] This set of events made Lovelace infamous in Victorian society. Ada did not have a relationship with her father. He died in April 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life. [ 15 ] Lovelace was not shown the family portrait of her father until her 20th birthday. [ 16 ]\nLovelace did not have a close relationship with her mother. She was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who doted on her. However, because of societal attitudes of the time\u2014which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation\u2014Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughter's welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern. [ 17 ] In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to her daughter as \"it\": \"I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own.\" [ 18 ] Lady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation. Lovelace dubbed these observers the \"Furies\" and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her. [ 19 ]\nLovelace was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision. [ 10 ] In June 1829, she was paralyzed after a bout of measles . She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, something which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite the illnesses, she developed her mathematical and technological skills.\nAda Byron had an affair with a tutor in early 1833. She tried to elope with him after she was caught, but the tutor's relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal. [ 20 ] Lovelace never met her younger half-sister, Allegra , the daughter of Lord Byron and Claire Clairmont . Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Lovelace did have some contact with Elizabeth Medora Leigh , the daughter of Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court. [ 21 ]\nLovelace became close friends with her tutor Mary Somerville , who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833. She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville, [ 22 ] and they corresponded for many years. Other acquaintances included the scientists Andrew Crosse , Sir David Brewster , Charles Wheatstone , Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens . She was presented at Court at the age of seventeen \"and became a popular belle of the season\" in part because of her \"brilliant mind\". [ 23 ] By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although John Hobhouse , Byron's friend, described her as \"a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend's features, particularly the mouth\". [ 24 ] This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably due to her mother's influence, which led her to dislike all of her father's friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became friends. [ 25 ]\nOn 8 July 1835, she married William, 8th Baron King , becoming Lady King. They had three homes: Ockham Park , Surrey; a Scottish estate on Loch Torridon in Ross-shire ; and a house in London. They spent their honeymoon at Ashley Combe near Porlock Weir , Somerset, which had been built as a hunting lodge in 1799 and was improved by King in preparation for their honeymoon. It later became their summer retreat and was further improved during this time. From 1845, the family's main house was Horsley Towers , built in the Tudorbethan fashion by the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Charles Barry , [ 26 ] [ 27 ] and later greatly enlarged to Lovelace's own designs.\nThey had three children: Byron (born 1836); Anne Isabella (called Annabella, born 1837); and Ralph Gordon (born 1839). Immediately after the birth of Annabella, Lady King experienced \"a tedious and suffering illness, which took months to cure\". [ 25 ] Ada was a descendant of the extinct Barons Lovelace and in 1838, her husband was made Earl of Lovelace and Viscount Ockham, meaning Ada became the Countess of Lovelace. [ 28 ] In 1843\u201344, Ada's mother assigned William Benjamin Carpenter to teach Ada's children and to act as a \"moral\" instructor for Ada. [ 29 ] He quickly fell for her and encouraged her to express any frustrated affections, claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an \"unbecoming\" manner. When it became clear that Carpenter was trying to start an affair, Ada cut it off. [ 30 ]\nIn 1841, Lovelace and Medora Leigh (the daughter of Lord Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh) were told by Ada's mother that Ada's father was also Medora's father. [ 31 ] On 27 February 1841, Ada wrote to her mother: \"I am not in the least astonished . In fact, you merely confirm what I have for years and years felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected.\" [ 32 ] She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed Augusta Leigh: \"I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was.\" [ 33 ] In the 1840s, Ada flirted with scandals: firstly, from a relaxed approach to extra-marital relationships with men, leading to rumours of affairs; [ 34 ] and secondly, from her love of gambling. She apparently lost more than \u00a33,000 on the horses during the later 1840s. [ 35 ] The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends, and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets. This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband. [ 36 ] She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse's son John from 1844 onwards. John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement. She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her. [ 37 ] During her final illness, she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her. [ 38 ]\nFrom 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge, [ 23 ] and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. [ 39 ] Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age. She was privately educated in mathematics and science by William Frend , William King , [ a ] and Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. In the 1840s, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan extended her \"much help in her mathematical studies\" including study of advanced calculus topics including the \" numbers of Bernoulli \" (that formed her celebrated algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine). [ 40 ] In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that Ada's skill in mathematics might lead her to become \"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\". [ 41 ]\nLovelace often questioned basic assumptions through integrating poetry and science. Whilst studying differential calculus , she wrote to De Morgan:\nLovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring \"the unseen worlds around us\". [ 43 ]\nLovelace died at the age of 36 on 27 November 1852 [ 44 ] from cervical cancer (which contemporary accounts called uterine cancer, since a distinction between the two was not made at that time). [ 45 ] [ 46 ] The illness lasted several months, in which time Lady Byron took command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants. Under her mother's influence, Ada had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Lady Byron her executor . [ 47 ] She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him. [ 48 ] She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. [ 49 ]\nThroughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including phrenology [ 50 ] and mesmerism . [ 51 ] After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844, she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings (\"a calculus of the nervous system\"). [ 52 ] She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running preoccupation, inherited from her mother, about her \"potential\" madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments. [ 53 ] In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach , Researches on Magnetism , but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft. [ 54 ] In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning \"certain productions\" she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music. [ 55 ]\nLovelace first met Charles Babbage in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month, Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his difference engine . [ 56 ] She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could. Babbage was impressed by Lovelace's intellect and analytic skills. He called her \"The Enchantress of Number\". [ 57 ] [ b ] In 1843, he wrote to her:\n[ 58 ]\nIn 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine. Luigi Menabrea , a young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy , transcribed Babbage's lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the Biblioth\u00e8que universelle de Gen\u00e8ve in October 1842. Babbage's friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English.\nDuring a nine-month period in 1842\u201343, Lovelace translated Menabrea's article. [ 59 ] She augmented the paper with seven notes, A to G, about three times longer than the translation. [ 60 ] The translation and notes were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs under her initials AAL . [ 61 ]\nExplaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task; many other scientists did not grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little interest in it. [ 62 ] Lovelace's notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine. [ 63 ] Her work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing. [ 64 ]\nLovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published, when he tried to leave his own statement (criticising the government's treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface, which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration. When Taylor 's Scientific Memoirs ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian Benjamin Woolley theorised that \"His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada's involvement, and so happily indulged her ... because of her 'celebrated name'.\" [ 65 ] Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as Philosopher's Walk; it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles. [ 64 ]\nThe notes are important in the early history of computers , especially since Note G [ 66 ] described, in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine, which might have run correctly had it ever been built. [ 67 ] Though Babbage's personal notes from 1837 to 1840 contain the first programs for the engine, [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] the algorithm in Note G is often called the first published computer program. The engine was never completed and so the program was never tested. [ 71 ]\nIn 1953, more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace's notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine were republished as an appendix to B. V. Bowden 's Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines . [ 72 ] The engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software. [ 67 ]\nBased on this work, Lovelace is often called the first computer programmer [ 73 ] [ 74 ] and her method has been called the world's first computer program. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ]\nEugene Eric Kim and Lovelace biographer, Betty Alexandra Toole, argued it was \"incorrect\" to regard Lovelace as the first computer programmer in an article for Scientific American . [ 71 ] Babbage claims credit in his autobiography for the algorithm in Note G, [ 78 ] and regardless of the extent of Lovelace's contribution to it, she was not the very first person to write a program for the Analytical Engine, as Babbage had written the initial programs for it, although the majority were never published. [ 71 ] Bromley notes several dozen sample programs prepared by Babbage between 1837 and 1840, all substantially predating Lovelace's notes. [ 79 ] Dorothy K. Stein regards Lovelace's notes as \"more a reflection of the mathematical uncertainty of the author, the political purposes of the inventor, and, above all, of the social and cultural context in which it was written, than a blueprint for a scientific development\". [ 80 ]\nAllan G. Bromley , in the 1990 article Difference and Analytical Engines :\nBruce Collier wrote that Lovelace \"made a considerable contribution to publicizing the Analytical Engine, but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in any way\". [ 82 ]\nDoron Swade has said that Ada only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it, but agrees that she was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities. [ 83 ]\nIn his book, Idea Makers , Stephen Wolfram defends Lovelace's contributions. While acknowledging that Babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the Analytical Engine prior to Lovelace's notes, Wolfram argues that \"there's nothing as sophisticated\u2014or as clean\u2014as Ada's computation of the Bernoulli numbers. Babbage certainly helped and commented on Ada's work, but she was definitely the driver of it.\" Wolfram then suggests that Lovelace's main achievement was to distill from Babbage's correspondence \"a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine\u2014something which Babbage never did\". [ 84 ]\nIn her notes, Ada Lovelace emphasised the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity. [ 85 ] She realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching. In her notes, she wrote:\nThis analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised. Walter Isaacson ascribes Ada's insight regarding the application of computing to any process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles: \"When she saw some mechanical looms that used punchcards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns , it reminded her of how Babbage's engine used punched cards to make calculations.\" [ 88 ] This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as the programmer John Graham-Cumming , whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ]\nAccording to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist Doron Swade :\nNote G also contains Lovelace's dismissal of artificial intelligence . She wrote that \"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.\" This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by Alan Turing in his paper \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \". [ 93 ] Most modern computer scientists argue that this view is outdated and that computer software can develop in ways that cannot necessarily be anticipated by programmers. [ 94 ]\nLovelace recognized the difference between the details of the computing mechanism, as covered in an 1834 article on the Difference Engine, [ 95 ] and the logical structure of the Analytical Engine, on which the article she was reviewing dwelt. She noted that different specialists might be required in each area.\nThe computer language Ada , created on behalf of the United States Department of Defense , was named after Lovelace. [ 96 ] The reference manual for the language was approved on 10 December 1980 and the Department of Defense Military Standard for the language, MIL-STD-1815 , was given the number of the year of her birth. [ 97 ]\nIn 1981, the Association for Women in Computing inaugurated its Ada Lovelace Award . [ 98 ] [ 99 ] As of 1998 [update] , the British Computer Society (BCS) has awarded the Lovelace Medal , [ 100 ] and in 2008 initiated an annual competition for women students. [ 101 ] BCSWomen sponsors the Lovelace Colloquium, an annual conference for women undergraduates. [ 101 ] In 2013, the University of Deusto in Spain established the Ada Byron Award for women in technology, which was subsequently expanded to several Latin American countries. [ 102 ]\nAda, the National College for Digital Skills , is a specialist college of further education and higher education in England, focused on digital skills. The college has campuses in London ( Pimlico ) and Manchester ( Ancoats ). The college teaches degree-level apprenticeship, as well as a sixth-form college for students aged 16 to 19. [ 103 ] [ 104 ]\nAda Lovelace Day is an annual event celebrated on the second Tuesday of October, [ 105 ] which began in 2009. [ 106 ] Its goal is to \"... raise the profile of women in science, technology, engineering, and maths,\" and to \"create new role models for girls and women\" in these fields. [ 106 ] Events have included Wikipedia edit-a-thons with the aim of improving the representation of women on Wikipedia in terms of articles and editors to reduce unintended gender bias on Wikipedia .\nThe Ada Initiative was a non-profit organisation dedicated to increasing the involvement of women in the free culture and open source movements . [ 107 ]\nThe building of the department of Engineering Mathematics at the University of Bristol is called the Ada Lovelace Building. [ 108 ]\nThe Engineering in Computer Science and Telecommunications College building in Zaragoza University is called the Ada Byron Building. [ 109 ]\nThe computer centre in the village of Porlock , near where Lovelace lived, is named after her.\nAda Lovelace House is a council-owned building in Kirkby-in-Ashfield , Nottinghamshire, near where Lovelace spent her infancy. [ 110 ] [ 111 ]\nIn 2012, a Google Doodle and blog post honoured her on her birthday. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] In 2013, Ada Developers Academy was founded and named after her. Its mission is to diversify tech by providing women and gender-diverse people the skills, experience, and community support to become professional software developers to change the face of tech. [ 114 ] On 17 September 2013, the BBC Radio 4 biography programme Great Lives devoted an episode to Ada Lovelace; she was sponsored by TV presenter Konnie Huq . [ 115 ]\nAs of November 2015, all new British passports have included an illustration of Lovelace and Babbage. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] In 2017, a Google Doodle honoured her with other women on International Women's Day . [ 118 ] On 2 February 2018, Satellogic , a high-resolution Earth observation imaging and analytics company, launched a \u00d1uSat type micro-satellite named in honour of Ada Lovelace. [ 119 ] In March 2018, The New York Times published a belated obituary for Ada Lovelace. [ 120 ]\nOn 27 July 2018, Senator Ron Wyden submitted, in the United States Senate , the designation of 9 October 2018 as National Ada Lovelace Day: \"To honor the life and contributions of Ada Lovelace as a leading woman in science and mathematics\". The resolution (S.Res.592) [ 121 ] was considered, and agreed to without amendment and with a preamble by unanimous consent. In November 2020 it was announced that Trinity College Dublin , whose library had previously held forty busts, all of them of men, was commissioning four new busts of women, one of whom was to be Lovelace. The four new busts (Ada Lovelace, Mary Wollstonecraft, Augusta Gregory and Rosalind Franklin) were unveiled on February 1, 2023 [ 122 ]\nIn March 2022, a statue of Ada Lovelace was installed at the site of the former Ergon House in the City of Westminster , London, honouring its scientific history. The redevelopment was part of a complex with Imperial Chemical House . [ 123 ] The statue was sculpted by Etienne and Mary Millner and based on the portrait by Margaret Sarah Carpenter . The sculpture was unveiled on International Women's Day, 2022. It stands on the 7th floor of Millbank Quarter overlooking the junction of Dean Bradley Street and Horseferry Road . [ 124 ]\nIn September 2022, Nvidia announced the Ada Lovelace graphics processing unit microarchitecture . [ 125 ] In July 2023, the Royal Mint issued four commemorative \u00a32 coins in various metals to \"honour the innovative contributions of computer science visionary Ada Lovelace and her legacy as a female trailblazer.\" [ 126 ]\nIn 2025, the National Portrait Gallery acquired three images of Lovelace\u2013the only known photographs of Lovelace. [ 127 ] Two were daguerreotypes by Antoine Claudet and were taken around 1843. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] The third was by an unknown photographer and is of Henry Wyndham Phillips \u2019 portrait of Lovelace. [ 130 ]\nIn February 2026, a statue of Lovelace was unveiled on the Hinckley campus of the North Warwickshire and South Leicestershire College. [ 131 ]\nThe bicentenary of Ada Lovelace's birth was celebrated with a number of events, including: [ 132 ]\nSpecial exhibitions were displayed by the Science Museum in London, England [ 141 ] and the Weston Library (part of the Bodleian Library ) in Oxford , England. [ 142 ]\nLovelace is portrayed in Romulus Linney 's 1977 play Childe Byron . [ 143 ] In Tom Stoppard 's 1993 play Arcadia , the precocious teenage genius Thomasina Coverly\u2014a character \"apparently based\" on Ada Lovelace (the play also involves Lord Byron )\u2014comes to understand chaos theory , and theorises the second law of thermodynamics , before either is officially recognised. [ 144 ] [ 145 ]\nIn the 1990 steampunk novel The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling , [ 146 ] Lovelace delivers a lecture on the \"punched cards\" programme which proves G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems decades before their actual discovery. Lovelace and Mary Shelley as teenagers are the central characters in Jordan Stratford 's steampunk series, The Wollstonecraft Detective Agency . [ 147 ]\nLovelace features in John Crowley 's 2005 novel, Lord Byron's Novel: The Evening Land , as an unseen character whose personality is forcefully depicted in her annotations and anti-heroic efforts to archive her father's lost novel. [ 148 ]\nThe 2015 play Ada and the Engine by Lauren Gunderson portrays Lovelace and Charles Babbage in unrequited love, and it imagines a post-death meeting between Lovelace and her father. [ 149 ] [ 150 ] Lovelace and Babbage are also the main characters in Sydney Padua 's webcomic and graphic novel The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage . The comic features extensive footnotes on the history of Ada Lovelace, and many lines of dialogue are drawn from actual correspondence. [ 151 ]\nPoet Jessy Randall included a tribute to Lovelace in her 2025 collection of poems about women scientists, The Path of Most Resistance . [ 152 ]\nIn the 1997 film Conceiving Ada , a computer scientist obsessed with Ada finds a way of communicating with her in the past by means of \"undying information waves\". [ 153 ]\nLovelace, identified as Ada Augusta Byron, is portrayed by Lily Lesser in the second series of The Frankenstein Chronicles aired on ITV in 2017. [ 154 ] She is employed as an \"analyst\" to provide the workings of a life-sized humanoid automaton. The brass workings of the machine are reminiscent of Babbage's analytical engine. Her employment is described as keeping her occupied until she returns to her studies in advanced mathematics. [ 155 ]\n\"Lovelace\" is the name of the operating system designed by the character Cameron Howe in Halt and Catch Fire , which aired on AMC in the US in 2015. [ 156 ]\nIn the documentary Calculating Ada: The Countess of Computing (2015), Dr Hannah Fry covers the life of Ada Lovelace. [ 157 ]\nLovelace and Babbage appear as characters in the second season of the ITV series Victoria (2017). Emerald Fennell portrays Lovelace in the episode, \"The Green-Eyed Monster.\" [ 158 ]\nLovelace features as a character in \" Spyfall, Part 2 \", the second episode of Doctor Who , series 12 , which first aired on BBC One on 5 January 2020. [ 159 ] The character was portrayed by Sylvie Briggs, alongside characterisations of Charles Babbage and Noor Inayat Khan . [ 159 ]\nSix copies of the 1843 first edition of Sketch of the Analytical Engine with Ada Lovelace's \"Notes\" [ 66 ] have been located. Three are held at Harvard University, one at the University of Oklahoma, and one at the United States Air Force Academy. [ 188 ] On 20 July 2018, the sixth copy was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for \u00a395,000. [ 189 ] A digital facsimile of one of the copies in the Harvard University Library is available online. [ 60 ]\nIn December 2016, a letter written by Ada Lovelace was forfeited by Martin Shkreli to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance for unpaid taxes owed by Shkreli. [ 190 ]",
      "education": "",
      "career": "Throughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including phrenology [ 50 ] and mesmerism . [ 51 ] After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844, she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings (\"a calculus of the nervous system\"). [ 52 ] She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running preoccupation, inherited from her mother, about her \"potential\" madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments. [ 53 ] In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach , Researches on Magnetism , but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft. [ 54 ] In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning \"certain productions\" she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music. [ 55 ]\nLovelace first met Charles Babbage in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month, Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his difference engine . [ 56 ] She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could. Babbage was impressed by Lovelace's intellect and analytic skills. He called her \"The Enchantress of Number\". [ 57 ] [ b ] In 1843, he wrote to her:\nForget this world and all its troubles and if possible its multitudinous Charlatans\u2014every thing in short but the Enchantress of Number. [ 57 ]\n[ 58 ]\nIn 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine. Luigi Menabrea , a young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy , transcribed Babbage's lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the Biblioth\u00e8que universelle de Gen\u00e8ve in October 1842. Babbage's friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English.\nDuring a nine-month period in 1842\u201343, Lovelace translated Menabrea's article. [ 59 ] She augmented the paper with seven notes, A to G, about three times longer than the translation. [ 60 ] The translation and notes were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs under her initials AAL . [ 61 ]\nExplaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task; many other scientists did not grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little interest in it. [ 62 ] Lovelace's notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine. [ 63 ] Her work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing. [ 64 ]\nLovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published, when he tried to leave his own statement (criticising the government's treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface, which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration. When Taylor 's Scientific Memoirs ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian Benjamin Woolley theorised that \"His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada's involvement, and so happily indulged her ... because of her 'celebrated name'.\" [ 65 ] Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as Philosopher's Walk; it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles. [ 64 ]\nThe notes are important in the early history of computers , especially since Note G [ 66 ] described, in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine, which might have run correctly had it ever been built. [ 67 ] Though Babbage's personal notes from 1837 to 1840 contain the first programs for the engine, [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] the algorithm in Note G is often called the first published computer program. The engine was never completed and so the program was never tested.

Stein regards Lovelace's notes as \"more a reflection of the mathematical uncertainty of the author, the political purposes of the inventor, and, above all, of the social and cultural context in which it was written, than a blueprint for a scientific development\". [ 80 ]\nAllan G. Bromley , in the 1990 article Difference and Analytical Engines :\nAll but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier. The exception was prepared by Babbage for her, although she did detect a \"bug\" in it. Not only is there no evidence that Ada ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine, but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so. [ 81 ]\nBruce Collier wrote that Lovelace \"made a considerable contribution to publicizing the Analytical Engine, but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in any way\". [ 82 ]\nDoron Swade has said that Ada only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it, but agrees that she was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities.

[ 84 ]\nIn her notes, Ada Lovelace emphasised the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity. [ 85 ] She realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching. In her notes, she wrote:\n[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides number , were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent. [ 86 ] [ 87 ]\nThis analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised. Walter Isaacson ascribes Ada's insight regarding the application of computing to any process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles: \"When she saw some mechanical looms that used punchcards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns , it reminded her of how Babbage's engine used punched cards to make calculations.\" [ 88 ] This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as the programmer John Graham-Cumming , whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ]\nAccording to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist Doron Swade :\nAda saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In Babbage's world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace saw...was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation\u2014to general-purpose computation\u2014and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper. [ 92 ]\nNote G also contains Lovelace's dismissal of artificial intelligence . She wrote that \"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.\" This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by Alan Turing in his paper \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \". [ 93 ] Most modern computer scientists argue that this view is outdated and that computer software can develop in ways that cannot necessarily be anticipated by programmers. [ 94 ]\nLovelace recognized the difference between the details of the computing mechanism, as covered in an 1834 article on the Difference Engine, [ 95 ] and the logical structure of the Analytical Engine, on which the article she was reviewing dwelt. She noted that different specialists might be required in each area.\nThe [1834 article] chiefly treats it under its mechanical aspect, entering but slightly into the mathematical principles of which that engine is the representative, but giving, in considerable length, many details of the mechanism and contrivances by means of which it tabulates the various orders of differences. M. Menabrea, on the contrary, exclusively develops the analytical view; taking it for granted that mechanism is able to perform certain processes, but without attempting to explain how; and devoting his whole attention to explanations and illustrations of the manner in which analytical laws can be so arranged and combined as to bring every branch of that vast subject within the grasp of the assumed powers of mechanism. It is obvious that, in the invention of a calculating engine, these two branches of the subject are equally essential fields of investigation... They are indissolubly connected, though so different in their intrinsic nature, that perhaps the same mind might not be likely to prove equally profound or successful in both. [ 66 ] : Note A",

      "lead": "Narendra Damodardas Modi [ a ] (born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician who has served as the prime minister of India since 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the member of parliament (MP) for Varanasi . He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindutva paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian National Congress .\nModi was born and raised in Vadnagar , Bombay State (present-day Gujarat ), where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, becoming a full-time worker for the organisation in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he rose through the party hierarchy, becoming general secretary in 1998. [ b ] In 2001, Modi was appointed chief minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat violence [ c ] and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. According to official records, a little over 1,000 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim, with many others raped, mutilated, or both. [ 4 ] A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him, causing widespread anger and disbelief among the country's Muslim communities. [ d ] While his policies as chief minister were credited for encouraging economic growth, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state. [ e ]\nIn the 2014 Indian general election , Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a party since 1984 . His administration increased direct foreign investment and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. His demonetisation of banknotes in 2016 and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017 sparked controversy. Modi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan; the airstrike failed, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] but the action had nationalist appeal. [ 7 ] Modi's party won the 2019 general election . In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act , prompting widespread protests and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Three controversial farm laws led to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic , during which, according to the World Health Organization , 4.7 million Indians died. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] In the 2024 general election , Modi's party lost its majority in the lower house of Parliament and formed a government leading the National Democratic Alliance coalition. Following a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, Modi presided over the 2025 India\u2013Pakistan conflict , which resulted in a ceasefire.\nUnder Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding and has shifted towards an authoritarian style of government, with a cult of personality centred around him. [ f ] As prime minister, he has received consistently high approval ratings within India. Modi has been described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics . He remains a highly controversial figure domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the Gujarat violence, which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda. [ g ]\nNarendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati family of Other Backward Class (OBC) background and Hindu faith [ 13 ] [ 14 ] in Vadnagar , Mehsana district , Bombay State (present-day Gujarat ). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi ( c. 1915\u20131989 ) and Hiraben Modi (1923\u20132022). [ 15 ] [ h ] [ 16 ] According to Modi and his neighbours, he worked infrequently in his father's tea stall in the Vadnagar railway station . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]\nModi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967; his teachers described him as an average student and a keen, gifted debater with an interest in theatre. [ 20 ] He preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]\nWhen Modi was eight years old, he was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, he met Lakshmanrao Inamdar , who inducted Modi as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor. [ 23 ] While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who in 1980 helped found the BJP's Gujarat unit. [ 24 ] As a teenager, he was enrolled in the National Cadet Corps . [ 25 ]\nIn a custom traditional to Narendra Modi's caste , his family arranged a betrothal to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi , leading to their marriage when she was 17 and he was 18. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] The marriage was never consummated, and Modi soon abandoned his wife, [ 28 ] [ 29 ] and left home. The couple never divorced but the marriage was not in his public pronouncements for many decades. [ 27 ] In April 2014, shortly before the national election in which he gained power, Modi publicly affirmed he was married and that his spouse was Jashodaben. [ 30 ] A Modi biographer wrote that Modi kept the marriage a secret because he would not have been able to become a pracharak in the RSS, for which celibacy had once been a requirement. [ 31 ] [ 32 ]\nModi spent the following two years travelling across northern and north-eastern India. [ 33 ] In mid 1968, Modi reached Belur Math but was turned away, after which he visited Calcutta , West Bengal and Assam , stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati . He then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora , where he was again rejected, before returning to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968 to 1969. In either late 1969 or early 1970, he returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad , [ 34 ] [ 35 ] where he lived with his uncle and worked in his uncle's canteen at Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation . [ 36 ] Swami Vivekananda has had a large influence in Modi's life. [ 37 ]\nIn Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Modi's first-known political activity as an adult was in 1971 when he joined a Jana Sangh Satyagraha in Delhi led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee to enlist to fight in the Bangladesh Liberation War . [ 41 ] [ 42 ] The Indira Gandhi -led central government prohibited open support for the Mukti Bahini ; according to Modi, he was briefly held in Tihar Jail . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 , Modi left his uncle's employment and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS, [ 46 ] working under Inamdar. [ 47 ] Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest in New Delhi against the Indian government, for which he was arrested; because of this arrest, Inamdar decided to mentor Modi. [ 47 ] According to Modi, he was part of a Satyagraha that led to a political war. [ 44 ] [ i ]\nIn 1978, Modi received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in political science from the School of Open Learning [ 50 ] at the Delhi University . [ 31 ] [ 51 ] In 1983, he received a Master of Arts (MA) degree in political science from Gujarat University , graduating with a first class [ 52 ] [ 53 ] as an external distance learning student. [ 54 ] There is a controversy surrounding the authenticity of his BA and MA degrees. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ j ]\nIn June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India that lasted until 1977. During this period, known as \"the Emergency\", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Modi was appointed general secretary of the \"Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti\", an RSS committee coordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned. [ 62 ] Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest, once dressing as a monk and once as a Sikh . [ 63 ] He became involved in the printing of pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] He was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals who were wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists. [ 66 ] During this period, Modi wrote a Gujarati-language book titled Sangharsh Ma Gujarat ( In the Struggles of Gujarat ), which describes events during the Emergency. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] While in this role, Modi met trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes and several other national political figures. [ 69 ]\nModi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing activities in Surat and Vadodara , and in 1979, he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he researched and wrote the RSS's history of the Emergency. Shortly after, he returned to Gujarat and in 1985, the RSS assigned him to the BJP. In 1987, Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the party won comfortably; according to biographers, Modi's planning was responsible for the win. [ 70 ] [ 71 ] After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the party; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role. Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987. [ 72 ]\nModi rose within the party and was named a member of its National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise Advani's Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi 's 1991\u20131992 Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity). [ 20 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Modi took a brief break from politics in 1992 to establish a school in Ahmedabad, and due to friction with Shankersinh Vaghela , a BJP MP from Gujarat. [ 74 ] Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani; as party secretary, Modi's electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly election . [ 75 ] [ 76 ] In November of that year, Modi was appointed BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh . [ 77 ] The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress [ k ] after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha election. [ 20 ] Modi, who was on the selection committee for the 1998 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election , favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as central to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 election, [ 78 ] and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year. [ 79 ]\nIn 2001, Keshubhai Patel 's health was failing, and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections . Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001 . [ 78 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement. [ 20 ] Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government. Modi declined an offer to become Patel's deputy chief minister , telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee he was \"going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all\". On 3 October 2001, Modi replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the upcoming December 2002 election. [ 82 ] On 7 October, Modi was sworn in [ 83 ] and he entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 after winning a by-election in Rajkot II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC after Vajubhai Vala vacated his seat. [ 84 ]\nOn 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra , killing approximately 60 people. [ l ] [ 87 ] The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims who were returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid . [ 88 ] [ 89 ] In a public statement, Modi said local Muslims were responsible for the incident. [ 90 ] [ 88 ] [ 91 ] The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh (general strike) across the state. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Riots began during the bandh and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat. [ 88 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence. [ 88 ] [ 94 ] The state government later stated 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed during the riots; [ 89 ] independent sources put the death toll at over 2,000, [ 88 ] [ 87 ] [ 95 ] the vast majority of them Muslims. [ 87 ] Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps. [ 96 ] Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilation of women. [ 97 ] [ 98 ]\nScholars consider the Government of Gujarat to have been complicit in the riots, [ 90 ] [ 99 ] and it has received much criticism for its handling of the situation; [ 100 ] some scholars explicitly blame Modi. [ 97 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ] The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets; these measures failed to prevent the violence from escalating. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh despite such actions being illegal at the time. [ 90 ] State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, which were often unable to meet the needs of those living there. [ 103 ] Muslim victims of the riots were subjected to further discrimination when the state government announced their compensation would be half that offered to Hindu victims; this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court. [ 104 ] During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able. [ 97 ] [ 91 ] [ 105 ] Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom and others have called it an example of state terrorism . [ 106 ] [ 107 ] [ 108 ] According to Martha Nussbaum , \"There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law\". [ 97 ]\nModi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, he said, \"What is happening is a chain of action and reaction\". [ 97 ] Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode. [ 109 ] In March 2008, the Supreme Court of India reopened several cases related to the riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre , and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue. [ 100 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri , the widow of Ehsan Jafri , who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre, in April 2009, the court also asked the SIT to investigate Modi's complicity in the killings. [ 110 ] The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him. [ 110 ] [ 112 ] In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT's position, Ramachandran said Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence. [ 113 ] [ 114 ] The Supreme Court sent the matter to the magistrate's court. The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jafri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013, the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding there was no evidence against Modi. [ 115 ] In 2022, the Supreme Court dismissed a petition by Zakia Jafri in which she challenged the clean chit given to Modi in the riots by the SIT, and upheld previous rulings that no evidence against him was found. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ]\nFollowing the violence, calls for Modi to resign as chief minister were made from politicians within and outside the state, including leaders of Janata Dal (United) and the Telugu Desam Party \u2014partners in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition\u2014and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue. [ 119 ] Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa but it was not accepted. [ 120 ] Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002. [ 121 ] In the election, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly. [ 122 ] Modi made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign, [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 126 ] and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among voters. [ 121 ] Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, [ 127 ] [ 123 ] a strategy that led to the BJP winning 127 of the 182 [ 122 ] seats\u2014a two-thirds majority\u2014in the state assembly. [ 127 ] [ 123 ] He won Maninagar constituency , defeating Congress candidate Yatin Oza. [ 128 ] On 22 December 2002, Modi was sworn in for a second term. [ 129 ]\nDuring Modi's second term, the government's rhetoric shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development. [ 80 ] [ 127 ] [ 123 ] He curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP). [ 130 ] When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration, Modi ordered the BKS's eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP. [ 130 ] [ 131 ] Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. He wrote a foreword to a 2014 textbook by Dinanath Batra , which made the unscientific claim that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies . [ 132 ] [ 133 ]\nModi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Indian general election , following which, Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots. [ 134 ] [ 135 ] Western nations also raised questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims: the US State Department barred him from entering the United States in accordance with the recommendations of that country's Commission on International Religious Freedom , [ 136 ] [ 137 ] the only person to be denied a US visa under this law. [ 136 ] The UK and the European Union (EU) refused to admit Modi because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK [ 138 ] and the EU [ 139 ] lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister in 2014, the US lifted its ban and invited him to Washington, D.C. [ 140 ] [ 141 ]\nDuring the run-up to the 2007 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election and the 2009 Indian general election , the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism. [ 142 ] Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \"for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act . [ 143 ] In 2007, Modi wrote Karmayog , a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, he said scavenging is a \"spiritual experience\" for Valmiks , a sub-caste of Dalits . [ 144 ] [ 145 ] The book was not circulated at that time because of the election code of conduct . [ 146 ] After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks , the Gujarat government authorised the deployment of 30 high-speed boats for coastal surveillance. [ 147 ] In July 2007, Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post. [ 148 ] The BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election. [ 149 ]\nDespite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's campaigns in 2007 and 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections contained elements of Hindu nationalism. He attended only Hindu religious ceremonies and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign, Modi twice refused to wear skullcap gifted by Muslim leaders. [ 123 ] He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra . [ 123 ] Modi's 2012 campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including Afzal Guru and the death of Sohrabuddin Sheikh . The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the 2012 assembly election. [ 123 ] During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India. [ 123 ] While campaigning for the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies, allowing him to reach a large number of people, [ 121 ] something he repeated in the 2014 general election. Modi won the constituency of Maninagar, defeating Shweta Bhatt of the INC. [ 150 ] The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure. [ 151 ] After his election as Prime Minister of India , Modi resigned as the Gujarat chief minister and as MLA for Maninagar. Anandiben Patel succeeded Modi as chief minister. [ 152 ]\nAs chief minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government , which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, which is usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. Modi's policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in Gujarat. He established financial and technology parks in the state and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth \u20b9 6.6 trillion (equivalent to \u20b9 20 trillion or US$240 billion in 2023) were signed. [ 80 ]\nThe governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of large scale groundwater-conservation projects, which commentators credited with helping about half of the tehsils with depleted groundwater recharge their aquifers. [ m ] As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India. [ 153 ] The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use [ 155 ] led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 per cent from 2001 to 2007. [ 156 ] Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam , were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project irrigated only 4\u20136% of the area intended. [ 153 ] In 2008, Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano car after popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal . Following Tata, several other companies relocated to Gujarat. [ 157 ]\nThe Modi government finished the process of taking electricity to every village in Gujarat its predecessor had almost completed. [ 158 ] Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Early protests by farmers ended when those who benefitted found their electricity supply had stabilised [ 153 ] but, according to an assessment study, corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers. [ 159 ]\nA contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarat's economic development during Modi's tenure as chief minister. [ 160 ] The state's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate averaged 10% during his tenure, similar to other highly industrialised states, and above that of the country. [ 157 ] Gujarat saw strong economic growth before Modi took office; some scholars state that growth did not accelerate during his tenure. [ 161 ] Under Modi, Gujarat performed well on measures of ease of doing business. [ n ] Tax breaks and land for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states. Modi's policies of making Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones in which labour laws were greatly weakened. [ 123 ] In the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism. [ 127 ]\nDespite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi's tenure. Gujarat was ranked poorly within the country on education, and was reported to have a poor record of immunisation of children. [ o ] Under much of Modi's tenure Gujarat did not significantly change its rank among Indian states with respect to poverty, female literacy, or infant mortality . [ p ] The state government's social policies generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis , and generally increased social inequalities. [ 104 ] Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas and those from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. [ 167 ] Under Modi, the state government spent less than the national average on education and healthcare. [ 104 ]\nOn 12 September 2013, Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election . [ 168 ] [ 169 ] [ 170 ] [ 171 ] [ 172 ] [ 173 ] According to Ram Madhav , Modi \"enjoyed the support of the people who wanted change\" [ 174 ] Several BJP leaders, [ 175 ] including BJP founding member L. K. Advani who cited concern with leaders who were \"concerned with their personal agendas\", expressed opposition to Modi's candidature. [ 176 ] Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's 2009 general election campaign. [ 177 ] [ 178 ] Although initially Swaraj endorsed Modi as prime minister, she later opposed declaring the candidature of Modi as it could be too early. [ 179 ] However, despite all the resistance, Rajnath Singh managed to pursue a lot of leaders and ensure that Modi becomes the official PM candidate of BJP. [ 172 ] Several people who voted for the BJP stated they would have voted for another party if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate. [ 170 ] [ 180 ] [ 181 ] The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign. [ 175 ] [ 182 ] The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi. [ 160 ]\nDuring the campaign, Modi focused on corruption scandals under the previous Congress government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat. [ 175 ] He projected himself as a person who could bring about \"development\" without focusing on specific policies. [ 175 ] His message found support among young and middle-class people. The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi's commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism. [ 178 ] Prior to the election, Modi's media image had centred around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots but during the campaign, the BJP focused on Modi's neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development. [ 178 ] The BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders who publicly opposed Hindu nationalism , including B. R. Ambedkar , Subhas Chandra Bose and Ram Manohar Lohia . [ 133 ] Hindutva remained a part of the campaign; BJP leaders used Hindutva-based rhetoric in several states. [ 183 ] [ 175 ] [ 180 ] [ 184 ] Communal tensions were played upon, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Northeast India . [ 183 ] A proposal for the controversial Uniform Civil Code was a part of the BJP's election manifesto. [ 184 ] The BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media. [ 165 ] Modi's campaign blitz cost around \u20b9 50 billion (US$590 million) [ 160 ] and the BJP received extensive financial support from corporate donors. [ 185 ] Modi made extensive use of social media [ 160 ] [ 175 ] and addressed more than 1,000 rallies via hologram appearances. [ 184 ]\nThe BJP won 31 per cent of the vote, [ 186 ] and more-than-doubled its number of seats in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984 . [ 178 ] [ 180 ] Voter dissatisfaction with the Congress and with regional parties in North India, and support from the RSS were reasons for the BJP's success. [ 180 ] [ 175 ] In states such as Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, and its Muslim vote increased to 10 per cent. The BJP performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims. [ 180 ] The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties towards the right-wing. [ 184 ] [ 160 ] [ 180 ] [ 187 ] [ 188 ] Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism. [ 189 ] Modi is the first Indian PM to be born after the country's independence from the British Empire in 1947. [ 190 ]\nModi was a candidate for the Lok Sabha constituencies Varanasi and Vadodara . [ 191 ] He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi by 371,784 votes and Madhusudan Mistry of the Congress in Vadodara by 570,128 votes. [ 192 ] India's president appointed Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, Prime Minister of India. [ 193 ] [ 194 ] To comply with the law prohibiting MPs from representing more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat. [ 195 ]\nOn 13 October 2018, Modi was named the BJP candidate for prime minister in the 2019 general election . [ 196 ] The BJP's chief campaigner was its president Amit Shah . Modi launched the party's Main Bhi Chowkidar (\"I too am a watchman\") campaign ahead of the general election, against the INC's campaign slogan Chowkidar Chor Hai (\"The watchman is a thief\"). [ 197 ] In 2018, the Telugu Desam Party split from the NDA over the campaign for special status for Andhra Pradesh . [ 198 ]\nAmit Shah launched the BJP's election campaign on 8 April 2019. In the campaign, the opposition targeted Modi on allegations of corruption over the Rafale deal with the Government of France , highlighting the controversy surrounding the deal . [ 199 ] Modi's campaign focused on defence and national security, especially after the Pulwama attack and the retaliatory Balakot airstrike , which was counted as an achievement of his administration. [ 200 ] [ 201 ] Other topics in the campaign were development and good foreign relations in the first premiership. [ 202 ]\nModi contested the Lok Sabha election as a candidate for Varanasi ; he won the seat by a margin of 479,505 votes, defeating Shalini Yadav of the Samajwadi Party (SP), who stood as a candidate for the SP- BSP alliance. [ 203 ] [ 204 ] Modi was unanimously appointed prime minister for a second time by the National Democratic Alliance [ 205 ] after the alliance won the election for the second time with 353 seats in the Lok Sabha; the BJP alone won 303 seats. [ 206 ] [ 207 ]\nIn November 2023, Modi was named the BJP candidate for prime minister in the 2024 general election . [ 208 ] The BJP's chief campaigner was its home minister Amit Shah and President J. P. Nadda . [ 209 ] Modi launched the party's \" Modi Ki Guarantee \" (\"Modi's assurance\") [ 210 ] campaign ahead of the general election, against the INC's guarantees campaigns, that led to the party's enormous victories in the assembly elections of Karnataka and Telangana . [ 211 ]\nModi contested the Lok Sabha election as a candidate for Varanasi for the third consecutive time; he won the seat by a margin of 152,513 votes, defeating Ajay Rai of the INC, who contested as a candidate for the SP-INC alliance. His victory margin was the second lowest ever (in percentage points) for a sitting prime minister in India after Chandra Sekhar . [ 212 ] [ 213 ] The National Democratic Alliance secured a total of 292 seats, 20 seats ahead of simple majority, and the BJP solely winning 240 seats. [ 214 ] [ 215 ] [ 216 ] Modi thanked the voters for reposing faith in his government for the 3rd consecutive time. [ 217 ]\nIn the 2025 Indian electoral controversy , Rahul Gandhi , leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha , claimed widespread electoral fraud and accused the Election Commission of India (ECI) of collusion with the ruling BJP during the 2024 general election. [ 218 ]\nModi's first year as PM saw significant centralisation of power. [ 133 ] [ 219 ] Modi, who initially lacked a majority in the Rajya Sabha , the upper house of Indian Parliament, passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. [ 220 ] His administration enacted a bill to increase its control over the appointment of judges and reducing that of the judiciary . [ 186 ] In December 2014, he abolished the Planning Commission , replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog), [ 221 ] [ 222 ] concentrating the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the PM. [ 220 ] [ 223 ] [ 224 ] The Planning Commission had in previous years been criticised for creating inefficiency in the government and of not fulfilling its role of improving social welfare but since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s , it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice. [ 222 ] [ 225 ] In its first year of administration, the Modi government launched investigations through the Intelligence Bureau into numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on the grounds these organisations were slowing economic growth. The investigations were criticised as a witch hunt . International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres , and environmental nonprofit organisation Sierra Club and Avaaz were among the groups that were investigated. [ 133 ] [ 223 ] Cases of sedition and terrorism laws were filed against individuals who criticised the government. [ 133 ] [ 226 ] This led to discontent within the BJP about his style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi. [ 133 ] [ 220 ]\nModi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister; 1,301 such laws had been repealed by previous governments in the previous 64 years. [ 227 ] [ 228 ] [ 229 ] Modi launched the Digital India programme with the goal of ensuring government services are available electronically, build infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boost manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promote digital literacy . [ 230 ] [ 231 ]\nIn 2019, a law to reserve 10 per cent of educational admission and government jobs for economically disadvantaged individuals was passed. [ 232 ] [ 233 ] In 2016, Modi's administration launched the Ujjwala scheme to provide free liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections to rural households. The scheme led to an additional 24% of Indian households having access to LPG in 2019 as compared to 2014. [ 234 ] In 2022, the government eliminated LPG subsidies for all citizens except those covered by the Ujjwala programme. [ 235 ]\nIn 2023, the Modi administration issued a notification constituting a high-level committee on One Nation, One Election , a proposal aimed to synchronise all elections in the country either on a single day or within a specific time frame. [ 236 ] In September 2024, the bill for One Nation, One Election was approved by the Modi Cabinet. [ 237 ] [ 238 ] [ 239 ]\nSince May 2023, ethnic tensions between some groups have resulted in violent clashes in Manipur . After 1 month of the violence, nearly 100 were killed and more than 36,000 people were displaced. [ 240 ] Modi has been criticised for his lack of reaction towards the violence. [ 241 ]\nThe activities of a number of Hindu nationalist organisations increased in scope after Modi's appointment as prime minister, sometimes with the government's support. [ 242 ] [ 243 ] These activities included a Hindu religious conversion programme , a campaign against the supposed Islamic practice of \" Love Jihad \" (an Islamophobic [ 249 ] conspiracy theory ) [ 244 ] : 226\u2013227 [ 250 ] : 1\u20132 [ 251 ] and attempts to celebrate Nathuram Godse , the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi , by members of the right-wing organisation Hindu Mahasabha . [ 252 ] [ 253 ] Government officials, including the home minister, defended the conversion programmes. [ 183 ]\nLinks between the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) grew stronger under Modi. The RSS provided organisational support to the BJP's electoral campaigns while the Modi administration appointed RSS-affiliated individuals to prominent government positions. [ 254 ] In 2014, Yellapragada Sudershan Rao , who had previously been associated with the RSS, became the chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR). [ 184 ] Historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the BJP, questioned Rao's credentials as a historian and stated the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism. [ 184 ] [ 255 ] [ 256 ] During its first term, the Modi administration appointed other RSS members to lead universities and research institutions, and recruitment of faculty members favouring the RSS increased. According to scholars Nandini Sundar and Kiran Bhatty, many of these appointees did not possess the qualifications for their positions. [ 257 ] The Modi administration also made numerous changes in government-approved history textbooks that de-emphasised the role of Jawaharlal Nehru and glorified that of Modi while also portraying Indian society as harmonious, and without conflict and inequity. [ 257 ] [ 258 ]\nIn 2019, the Modi administration passed a citizenship law that provides a route to Indian citizenship for persecuted religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians, [ 259 ] [ 260 ] but does not grant eligibility to Muslims. [ 261 ] [ 262 ] [ 263 ] This was first time religion had been overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law; it attracted global criticism and prompted widespread protests that were halted by the COVID-19 pandemic . [ 257 ] [ 263 ] [ 264 ] Counter-demonstrations against the protests developed into the 2020 Delhi riots , caused chiefly by Hindu mobs attacking Muslims. [ 265 ] [ 266 ] Fifty-three people were killed in the protests, two-thirds of whom were Muslim. [ 267 ] [ 268 ] [ 269 ] [ 270 ] [ 271 ] On 5 August 2020, Modi visited Ayodhya after the Supreme Court in 2019 ordered contested land in Ayodhya to be handed to a trust to build a Hindu temple and ordered the government to give alternative 5 acres (2.0 ha) of land to the Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque. [ 272 ] Modi became the first PM to visit temples at Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanuman Garhi . [ 273 ]\nSoon after Modi returned to power in 2019, he took three actions the RSS had long called for. [ 257 ] The practice of Triple Talaq was made illegal and became a punishable act from 1 August 2019. [ 274 ] [ 275 ] [ 276 ] The administration repealed Article 370 of the Indian constitution that granted autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir , [ 277 ] [ 278 ] and also abrogated its statehood , reorganising it into the union territories Jammu and Kashmir , and Ladakh . [ 257 ] [ 279 ] The region was placed under a lockdown and internet services were suspended and were not completely restored until February 2021. [ 280 ] Thousands of people, including hundreds of political leaders, were detained. [ 281 ] [ 282 ] [ 283 ] [ 284 ] The Supreme Court of India did not hear constitutional challenges to the reorganisation or the Citizenship Amendment Act. According to Bhatty and Sundar, this is an example of the subversion of the Supreme Court and other major institutions, which were filled with appointees favouring the BJP. [ 257 ]\nDuring his campaign for 2024 Indian general election , Modi referred to Muslims as infiltrators with many children who would take India's wealth, if his political opponents gained power. [ 285 ] [ 286 ] In a later interview, Modi said that regardless of the social class, there are more children in neighbourhoods plagued by poverty. He said he made no mention of Muslim or Hindu in his campaign speech. [ 287 ] [ 288 ] However, factcheckers have refuted this claim of Modi and found numerous instances across his election campaign where he communally targeted the Muslims. [ 289 ] [ 290 ]\nThe Modi government's economic policies focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, and were based on a neoliberal framework. [ 223 ] [ 291 ] Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including defence and railways. [ 223 ] [ 292 ] [ 293 ] Other proposed reforms included making the forming of unions more difficult for workers, and making recruitment and dismissal easier for employers; [ 291 ] some of these proposals were abandoned after protests. [ 294 ] The reforms drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions\u2014including one affiliated with the BJP\u2014struck. [ 291 ] The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (Indian Workers Union), a constituent of the Sangh Parivar (Family of the RSS), stated the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers. [ 223 ]\nThe funds dedicated to poverty-reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly reduced by Modi's administration. [ 133 ] The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6 per cent of GDP during the previous Congress government to 12.6 per cent during Modi's first year in office, and spending on health and family welfare declined by 15 per cent. [ 223 ] The government lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax , increased sales taxes, and reduced customs duties on gold and jewellery. [ 223 ] In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices. [ 295 ] During Modi's first term, his government reduced spending on education as share of the budget: over five years, education spending dropped from 0.7 per cent of GDP to 0.5 per cent. [ 296 ] [ 297 ] [ 298 ] The percentage of the budget spent on children's nutrition, education, health, and associated programmes was almost halved between 2014 and 2022. [ 299 ] Capital expenditure on transport infrastructure significantly rose, increasing from less than 0.4 per cent of GDP in 2014 to 1.7 per cent in 2023. [ 300 ]\nIn September 2014, Modi introduced the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub. [ 223 ] [ 301 ] Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative but critics said it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market. [ 223 ] Modi's administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it. [ 302 ] The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in Parliament but was eventually allowed to lapse. [ 220 ] Modi's government passed the Goods and Services Tax , the biggest tax reform in the country since independence, subsuming around 17 taxes and became effective on 1 July 2017. [ 303 ]\nIn his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate black money . [ 304 ] On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised \u20b9500 and \u20b91000 banknotes with the intention of curbing corruption, black money, terrorism and the use of counterfeit currency. [ 305 ] The move led to severe cash shortages, [ 306 ] [ 307 ] [ 308 ] and a steep decline in the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 , [ 309 ] and sparked widespread protests throughout the country. [ 310 ] It is estimated 1.5 million jobs were lost and that one per cent of the country's GDP was wiped out. [ 311 ] Several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash. [ 312 ] [ 313 ] In the subsequent year, the number of income tax returns filed for individuals rose by 25 per cent and the number of digital transactions steeply increased. [ 314 ] [ 315 ]\nModi's administration has observed a decline in GDP growth and increasing joblessness compared to the previous administration under Manmohan Singh . [ 316 ] During the first eight years of Modi's premiership, India's GDP grew at an average rate of 5.5 per cent compared to the rate of 7.03 per cent under the previous government. [ 317 ] Income inequality increased. [ 318 ] An internal government report said in 2017, unemployment increased to its highest level in 45 years. The loss of jobs was attributed to the 2016 banknote demonetisation, and the effects of the Goods and Services Tax . [ 319 ] [ 320 ] GDP growth was 6.12 per cent in the 2018\u201319 financial year , with an inflation rate of 3.4 per cent. [ 321 ] In the year 2019\u201320, the GDP growth rate slowed to 4.18 per cent, while inflation increased to 4.7 per cent. [ 322 ] The Indian economy shrunk by 6.6 per cent during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020\u201321, and was estimated to grow at 8.2 per cent the following financial year. [ 323 ] In 2025, Modi's government announced reforms to the country's goods and services tax and labour laws . [ 324 ]\nIn his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the central government's healthcare spending. [ 166 ] In January 2015, the Modi government launched its New Health Policy (NHP), which did not increase the government's spending on healthcare but emphasised the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including a reduction in child and maternal mortality rates. [ 325 ] The National Health Mission , which included public health programmes targeted at these indices, received nearly 20 per cent less funding [ 326 ] [ 327 ] in 2015 than in the previous year. The Modi administration reduced the healthcare budget by a further 15% in its second year. [ 328 ] The healthcare budget for the following year rose by 19%; private insurance providers positively viewed the budget but public health experts criticised its emphasis on the role of private healthcare providers and said it represented a shift away from public health facilities. [ 329 ] The healthcare budget rose by 11.5% in 2018; the change included an allocation of \u20b9 20 billion (US$240 million) for a government-funded health insurance programme and a decrease in the budget of the National Health Mission . [ 330 ]\nModi emphasised his government's efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health. [ 325 ] On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Mission (\"Clean India\") campaign. The campaign's stated goals included the elimination of open defecation and manual scavenging within five years. [ 331 ] [ 332 ] As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them. [ 333 ] [ 334 ] [ 335 ] The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants, [ 336 ] and planned to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. The construction projects faced allegations of corruption and severe difficulty in getting people to use the newly constructed toilets. [ 332 ] [ 333 ] [ 334 ] Sanitation cover in India increased from 38.7% in October 2014 to 84.1% in May 2018 but use of the new sanitary facilities was lower than the government's targets. [ 337 ] In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated at least 180,000 diarrhoeal deaths in rural India were averted after the launch of the sanitation effort. [ 338 ]\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic , the Modi administration invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005 . [ 339 ] [ 340 ] The same month, all commercial domestic and international flights were suspended. [ 341 ] Modi announced a 14-hour curfew on 22 March, [ 342 ] and followed with a three-week \"total lockdown\" two days later. [ 343 ] [ 344 ] Restrictions were gradually lifted beginning in April, and were completely revoked in November 2020. [ 341 ] [ 345 ] [ 346 ] A second wave of the pandemic that began in March 2021 was significantly more devastating than the first; some parts of India experienced shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies. [ 347 ] In late April India reported over 400,000 cases in a 24-hour period, the first country to do so. [ 348 ] India began its vaccination programme in January 2021; [ 349 ] [ 350 ] in January 2022, India announced it had administered about 1.7 billion doses of vaccines and that more than 720 million people were fully vaccinated. [ 351 ] In May 2022, the WHO estimated 4.7 million people had died of COVID-19 in India, mostly during the second wave in mid 2021\u2014almost 10 times the Indian government's estimate. The Modi administration rejected the WHO's estimate. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]\nForeign policy played a small role in Modi's election campaign and did not feature prominently in the BJP's election manifesto. [ 352 ] Modi's foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding Congress government, focused on improving economic ties, security and regional relations. [ 352 ] Modi continued Manmohan Singh's policy of \"multi-alignment\". [ 352 ] The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially East Asia, with the use of slogans such as \" Make in India \" and \" Digital India \". The government also tried to improve relations with Islamic nations in the Middle East , such as Bahrain , Iran , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , as well as with Israel . [ q ]\nIndia's relationship with the United States improved after Narendra Modi became PM. [ 354 ] During the run-up to the general election, there was wide-ranging scepticism about future of the strategic bilateral relationship under Modi's premiership; in 2005, while Chief Minister of Gujarat , Modi was denied a US visa during the presidency of George W. Bush for his poor human-rights record. [ 136 ] [ 137 ] Sensing Modi's victory well before the election, US Ambassador to India Nancy Powell contacted Modi as part of greater rapprochement from the West. Following Modi's 2014 appointment as India's PM, President Obama congratulated him over the telephone and invited Modi to visit the US. [ 355 ] The Modi government enjoyed a positive relationship with the US during the presidencies of Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump . [ 356 ] [ 357 ]\nDuring the first few months after his appointment as PM, Modi visited a number of countries in support of his policy, and attended the BRICS , ASEAN and G20 summits. [ 352 ] One of Modi's first visits as PM was to Nepal, during which he promised one billion US dollars in aid. [ 358 ] Modi also made several visits to the US; [ 359 ] this was described as an unexpected development because of the US's earlier denial of a US travel visa to Modi over his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots. The visits were expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries. [ 359 ]\nIn 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land-exchange deal with Bangladesh in the India\u2013Bangladesh enclaves , which the government of Manmohan Singh had initiated. [ 220 ] Modi's administration brought renewed attention to India's \"Look East Policy\", which was instituted in 1991. The policy, which was renamed the \"Act East Policy\", involved directing Indian foreign policy towards East Asia and Southeast Asia . [ 360 ] The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with Myanmar through the Indian state of Manipur ; this represented a break with India's historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade. [ 360 ] China\u2013India relations rapidly deteriorated following the 2020 China\u2013India skirmishes . [ 361 ] Modi pledged aid of $900 million to Afghanistan, which he visited twice and was honoured with Afghanistan's highest civilian honour in 2016. [ 362 ] [ 363 ] In September 2022, Modi appeared to have developed a strong personal relationship with Russia's president Vladimir Putin . [ 364 ] [ 365 ] [ 366 ]\nIndia hosted the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit , during which the African Union joined the G20 as a permanent member. [ 367 ] In an interview on 26 August 2023, Prime Minister Modi expressed optimism about the G20 countries' evolving agenda under India's presidency, shifting toward a human-centric development approach that aligns with the concerns of the Global South , including addressing climate change , debt restructuring through the G20's Common Framework for Debt, and a strategy for regulation of global cryptocurrencies . [ 368 ] [ 369 ] [ 370 ] Modi's government faced scrutiny in the lead-up to the G20 meeting as multiple news sources reported that Indian authorities demolished slum neighbourhoods in New Delhi , displacing marginalised residents. [ 371 ] [ 372 ] [ 373 ]\nIndia's nominal military spending steadily increased under Modi. [ 374 ] During Modi's tenure, the military budget declined, both as a fraction of GDP and when adjusted for inflation. [ 375 ] [ 376 ] A substantial portion of the military budget was devoted to personnel costs. Commentators wrote the budget was constraining Indian military modernisation. [ 375 ] [ 377 ] [ 376 ]\nUnder Modi, India launched military modernisation initiative aimed at strengthening defence preparedness and streamlining defence acquisition. [ 378 ] Modi launched new policies under the \" Aatmanirbhar Bharat \" campaign, promoting indigenous defence manufacturing with policies to procure key weapon systems domestically. The government has implemented several of the recommendations from the Shekatkar Committee to streamline defence procurement and rationalise spending. Efforts have been made to establish Integrated Theatre Commands (ITCs) to enhance jointness among the services, although challenges persist in their full operationalisation. [ 379 ]\nModi promised to be \"tough on Pakistan\" during his election campaign and repeatedly called Pakistan an exporter of terrorism . [ 380 ] [ 381 ] [ 382 ] On 29 September 2016, the Modi administration said the Indian Army had conducted a surgical strike on terror launch pads in Azad Kashmir ; the Indian media said up to 50 terrorists and Pakistani soldiers had been killed in the strike. [ 383 ] [ 384 ] [ 385 ] Independent analysts said India's statement about the scope of the strike and the number of casualties had been exaggerated. [ 386 ] [ 387 ] [ 388 ] [ 389 ] Pakistan denied any surgical strikes to have taken place. [ 390 ] In February 2019, India carried out airstrikes against a supposed terrorist camp in Pakistan; open source satellite imagery suggested no targets of significance were hit. [ 391 ] [ 392 ] Further military skirmishes , including cross-border shelling and the loss of an Indian aircraft, occurred. [ 393 ] [ 394 ] [ 395 ] Eight months after the incident, the Modi administration admitted that six Indian military personnel had been killed by friendly fire . [ 396 ]\nIn May 2020, Chinese and Indian troops engaged in aggressive skirmishes along the Sino-Indian border , including near the disputed Pangong Lake , Ladakh , and the Tibet Autonomous Region and near the border between Sikkim and the Tibet Autonomous Region . Additional clashes took place in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). [ 397 ] In 2020, there were high-profile skirmishes between the nations. [ 398 ] A series of talks between India and China were held. [ 399 ] The first border clash reported in 2021 was on 20 January; this was referred to as a minor border clash in Sikkim. [ 400 ] Modi was from late 2022 criticised for maintaining silence over the ceding of about 2,000 km 2 land to China since June 2020. [ 401 ] [ 402 ] [ 403 ]\nIn December 2021, Modi signed an agreement with Russian president Vladimir Putin to extend military technical cooperation. [ 404 ] The Modi government bought the S-400 missile system , an anti-missile striking system, strengthening the relationship between the two nations. [ 405 ] India refused to condemn the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and stayed neutral. [ 404 ] [ 406 ] The Indian government's Operation Ganga initiative sought to return Indians stranded in Ukraine during the war. More than 19,000 Indian nationals were evacuated, [ 407 ] [ 408 ] including some from neighbouring countries. [ 409 ]\nFollowing the April 2025 Pahalgam attack in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir by The Resistance Front , an offshoot of the Pakistan-based militant organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba , [ 410 ] the Modi government accused Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism and suspended the Indus Waters Treaty and all bilateral trade. Pakistan rejected the accusation and in response suspended the Simla Agreement and all trade with India. On 7 May, India launched Operation Sindoor , against terror launch pads used by the Jaish-e-Mohammed , Lashkar-e-Taiba , and Hizbul Mujahideen in Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and Pakistani Punjab . [ 411 ] [ 412 ] On 10 May, Pakistan retaliated by targeting Indian military sites along the border. Following a further increase in hostilities, the countries agreed to a ceasefire the same day and ended the conflict. [ 413 ]\nWhile naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the Ministry of Environment and Forests the \" Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change \", and reduced its budget allocation by more than half in his administration's first budget. [ 414 ] The new ministry removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection, and others related to industrial activity. [ 223 ] The government also tried to reconstitute the National Board for Wildlife so it would no longer have representatives from NGOs but the Supreme Court of India blocked this move. [ 415 ] Other changes included a reduction of ministry oversight on small mining projects and ending the requirement for approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. Modi also lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in India's most-polluted areas. [ 415 ] The changes were welcomed by businesspeople but criticised by environmentalists. [ 416 ]\nSpeaking with Assamese students in 2014, Modi downplayed climate change , saying, \"Climate has not changed. We have changed. Our habits have changed. Our habits have got spoiled. Due to that, we have destroyed our entire environment.\" [ 417 ] Later in his administration, however, he has called for climate action , [ 418 ] [ 419 ] especially with the proliferation of clean energy . [ 420 ] [ 421 ] In 2015, Modi proposed the International Solar Alliance initiative to encourage investment in solar energy. [ 422 ] Holding developed countries responsible, [ 423 ] Modi and his government have said India has had a negligible historical role in climate change. At the COP26 conference, Modi announced India would target carbon neutrality by 2070 and expand its renewable energy capacity. [ 424 ] Indian environmentalists and economists applauded the decision, describing it as bold climate action. [ 425 ] India has become the only major economy to be on track to meet its Paris Agreement goals. [ 426 ] It has achieved 10 per cent of ethanol blending five months ahead of schedule. [ 427 ]\nUnder Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding . [ f ] His rule is known for weakening of democratic institutions, individual rights , and freedom of expression . [ 428 ] [ 429 ] According to one study, \"The BJP government incrementally but systemically attacked nearly all existing mechanisms that are in place to hold the political executive to account, either by ensuring that these mechanisms became subservient to the political executive or were captured by party loyalists\". [ 430 ] [ 431 ] The Modi government has used state power to intimidate and stifle critics in the media and academia, undermining freedom of expression and alternative sources of information. [ 432 ] [ 433 ] His administration has been criticised for using a democratic mandate to undermine democratic processes, including focusing on Hindu-nationalist priorities rather than economic development. Modi's second term as PM, in particular, saw the erosion of civil rights and press freedom . [ 434 ]\nModi is the longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian National Congress , [ 435 ] and has received consistently high approval ratings during his premiership. [ 436 ] [ 437 ] [ 438 ]\nModi is considered to be a vegetarian and a teetotaller . [ 439 ] [ 440 ] On 31 August 2012, he posted on Google Hangouts , becoming the first Indian politician to interact with citizens on a live chat. [ 441 ] [ 442 ] Modi regularly wears an ironed, half-sleeved kurta , and his suit has his name repeatedly embroidered in the pinstripes, which he wore during a state visit by US president Barack Obama , which drew public and media attention, and criticism. [ 443 ] [ 444 ] [ 445 ] [ clarification needed ] Scholars and biographers have described Modi's personality as energetic, eccentric, arrogant, and charismatic. [ 186 ] [ 446 ]\nThe nomination of Modi for the prime-ministership drew attention to his reputation as \"one of contemporary India's most controversial and divisive politicians\". [ 160 ] [ 447 ] [ 448 ] During the 2014 election campaign, the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader who would be able to take difficult decisions. [ 160 ] [ 170 ] [ 175 ] [ 180 ] [ 181 ] Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, an unusual tactic for the BJP and RSS. [ 175 ] Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and development. [ 449 ] Modi's role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy.
